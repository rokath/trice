NAME
       screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation

SYNOPSIS
       screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ]
       screen -r [[pid.]tty[.host]]
       screen -r sessionowner/[[pid.]tty[.host]]

DESCRIPTION
       Screen  is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each vir-
       tual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI  X3.64)
       and  ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual
       terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.

       When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use
       the  program  as  you  normally  would.   Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more
       shells), kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn output logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view the  scrollback
       history,  switch  between windows in whatever manner you wish, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs
       continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the user's terminal.   When  a
       program  terminates,  screen (per default) kills the window that contained it.  If this window was in the foreground, the display switches to the
       previous window; if none are left, screen exits. Shells usually distinguish between running as login-shell or sub-shell.   Screen  runs  them  as
       sub-shells, unless told otherwise (See shell .screenrc command).

       Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current window.  The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initi-
       ate a command to the window manager.  By default, each command begins with a control-a (abbreviated C-a from now on),  and  is  followed  by  one
       other  keystroke.   The  command  character  and all the key bindings can be fully customized to be anything you like, though they are always two
       characters in length.

       Screen does not understand the prefix C- to mean control, although this notation is used in this manual for readability.  Please  use  the  caret
       notation  (^A  instead  of C-a) as arguments to e.g. the escape command or the -e option.  Screen will also print out control characters in caret
       notation.

       The standard way to create a new window is to type C-a c.  This creates a new window running a shell and switches to that window immediately, re-
       gardless  of the state of the process running in the current window.  Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom command in it by first
       binding the command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or at the C-a : command line) and then using it just like the C-a c command.  In addi-
       tion, new windows can be created by running a command like:

              screen emacs prog.c

       from  a  shell prompt within a previously created window.  This will not run another copy of screen, but will instead supply the command name and
       its arguments to the window manager (specified in the $STY environment variable) who will use it to create the new  window.   The  above  example
       would  start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch to its window. - Note that you cannot transport environment variables from the invoking
       shell to the application (emacs in this case), because it is forked from the parent screen process, not from the invoking shell.

       If /run/utmp is writable by screen, an appropriate record will be written to this file for each window, and removed when  the  window  is  termi-
       nated.   This  is  useful for working with talk, script, shutdown, rsend, sccs and other similar programs that use the utmp file to determine who
       you are. As long as screen is active on your terminal, the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp file. See also C-a L.

GETTING STARTED
       Before you begin to use screen you'll need to make sure you have correctly selected your terminal type, just as you would  for  any  other  term-
       cap/terminfo program.  (You can do this by using test for example.)

       If  you're  impatient  and  want to get started without doing a lot more reading, you should remember this one command:  C-a ?.  Typing these two
       characters will display a list of the available screen commands and their bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in the section DEFAULT KEY  BIND-
       INGS. The manual section CUSTOMIZATION deals with the contents of your .screenrc.

       If  your  terminal  is  a true auto-margin terminal (it doesn't allow the last position on the screen to be updated without scrolling the screen)
       consider using a version of your terminal's termcap that has automatic margins turned off. This will ensure an accurate and optimal update of the
       screen in all circumstances. Most terminals nowadays have magic margins (automatic margins plus usable last column). This is the VT100 style type
       and perfectly suited for screen.  If all you've got is a true auto-margin terminal screen will be content to use it, but updating a character put
       into  the  last  position on the screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls or the character is moved into a safe position in some other
       way. This delay can be shortened by using a terminal with insert-character capability.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       Screen has the following command-line options:

       -a   include all capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each window's termcap, even if screen must redraw parts of the display in order  to
            implement a function.

       -A   Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the current terminal.  By default, screen tries to restore its old window sizes when attaching
            to resizable terminals (those with WS in its description, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).

       -c file
            override the default configuration file from $HOME/.screenrc to file.

       -d|-D [pid.tty.host]
            does not start screen, but detaches the elsewhere running screen session. It has the same effect as typing C-a d from  screen's  controlling
            terminal.  -D  is  the  equivalent  to the power detach key.  If no session can be detached, this option is ignored. In combination with the
            -r/-R option more powerful effects can be achieved:

       -d -r   Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.

       -d -R   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.

       -d -RR  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one session is available.

       -D -r   Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.

       -D -R   Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.  If  it
               was not running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.

       -D -RR  Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.

            Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of your sessions by means of screen -list.

       -e xy
            specifies  the command character to be x and the character generating a literal command character to y (when typed after the command charac-
            ter).  The default is C-a and `a', which can be specified as -e^Aa.  When creating a screen session, this option sets  the  default  command
            character.  In a multiuser session all users added will start off with this command character. But when attaching to an already running ses-
            sion, this option changes only the command character of the attaching user.  This option is equivalent to either the commands  defescape  or
            escape respectively.

       -f, -fn, and -fa
            turns flow-control on, off, or automatic switching mode.  This can also be defined through the defflow .screenrc command.

       -h num
            Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be num lines high.

       -i   will  cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display immediately when flow-control is on.  See the defflow .screenrc command
            for details.  The use of this option is discouraged.

       -l and -ln
            turns login mode on or off (for /run/utmp updating).  This can also be defined through the deflogin .screenrc command.

       -ls [match]
       -list [match]
            does not start screen, but prints a list of pid.tty.host strings and creation timestamps identifying your screen sessions.  Sessions  marked
            `detached' can be resumed with screen -r. Those marked `attached' are running and have a controlling terminal. If the session runs in multi-
            user mode, it is marked `multi'. Sessions marked as `unreachable' either live on a different host or are `dead'.  An unreachable session  is
            considered  dead,  when  its  name matches either the name of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any.  See the -r flag for a de-
            scription how to construct matches.  Sessions marked as `dead' should be thoroughly checked and removed.  Ask your system  administrator  if
            you are not sure. Remove sessions with the -wipe option.

       -L   tells screen to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.

       -Logfile file
            By default logfile name is screenlog.0. You can set new logfile name with the -Logfile option.

       -m   causes  screen  to  ignore the $STY environment variable. With screen -m creation of a new session is enforced, regardless whether screen is
            called from within another screen session or not. This flag has a special meaning in connection with the `-d' option:

       -d -m   Start screen in detached mode. This creates a new session but doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.

       -D -m   This also starts screen in detached mode, but doesn't fork a new process. The command exits if the session terminates.

       -O   selects an optimal output mode for your terminal rather than true VT100 emulation (only affects auto-margin terminals without  `LP').   This
            can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP' in a termcap command.

       -p number_or_name|-|=|+
            Preselect  a window. This is useful when you want to reattach to a specific window or you want to send a command via the -X option to a spe-
            cific window. As with screen's select command, - selects the blank window. As a special case for reattach, = brings up the windowlist on the
            blank window, while a + will create a new window. The command will not be executed if the specified window could not be found.

       -q   Suppress  printing of error messages. In combination with -ls the exit value is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without sessions. 10 in-
            dicates a directory with running but not attachable sessions. 11 (or more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.  In  combination  with  -r
            the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates that there is no session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there are 2 (or more) sessions to
            resume and you should specify which one to choose.  In all other cases -q has no effect.

       -Q   Some commands now can be queried from a remote session using this flag, e.g. screen -Q windows. The commands will send the response  to  the
            stdout of the querying process. If there was an error in the command, then the querying process will exit with a non-zero status.

            The commands that can be queried now are:
             echo
             info
             lastmsg
             number
             select
             time
             title
             windows

       -r [pid.tty.host]
       -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host]
            resumes  a  detached  screen  session.   No  other  options  (except combinations with -d/-D) may be specified, though an optional prefix of
            [pid.]tty.host may be needed to distinguish between multiple detached screen sessions.  The second form is used to connect to another user's
            screen  session which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates that screen should look for sessions in another user's directory. This requires
            setuid-root.

       -R   resumes screen only when it's unambiguous which one to attach, usually when only one screen is detached. Otherwise lists available sessions.
            -RR attempts to resume the youngest (in terms of creation time) detached screen session it finds.  If successful, all other command-line op-
            tions are ignored.  If no detached session exists, starts a new session using the specified options, just as if -R had not  been  specified.
            The  option  is  set by default if screen is run as a login-shell (actually screen uses -xRR in that case).  For combinations with the -d/-D
            option see there.  Note: Time-based session selection is a Debian addition.

       -s program
            sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the value in the environment variable $SHELL (or /bin/sh if not defined).   This
            can also be defined through the shell .screenrc command.  See also there.

       -S sessionname
            When  creating  a  new  session,  this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session. This name identifies the session for
            screen -list and screen -r actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix. This name should not be longer then 80 symbols.

       -t name
            sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified program.  See also the shelltitle .screenrc command.

       -T term
            Set the $TERM environment variable using the specified term as opposed to the default setting of screen.

       -U   Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your terminal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets  the  de-
            fault encoding for new windows to `utf8'.

       -v   Print version number.

       -wipe [match]
            does  the  same as screen -ls, but removes destroyed sessions instead of marking them as `dead'.  An unreachable session is considered dead,
            when its name matches either the name of the local host, or the explicitly given parameter, if any.  See the -r flag for a  description  how
            to construct matches.

       -x   Attach  to  a  not detached screen session. (Multi display mode).  Screen refuses to attach from within itself.  But when cascading multiple
            screens, loops are not detected; take care.

       -X   Send the specified command to a running screen session. You may use the -S option to specify the screen session if you have  several  screen
            sessions  running. You can use the -d or -r option to tell screen to look only for attached or detached screen sessions. Note that this com-
            mand doesn't work if the session is password protected.

       -4   Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses.

       -6   Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses.

DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
       As mentioned, each screen command consists of a C-a followed by one other character.  For your convenience, all commands that are bound to lower-
       case  letters are also bound to their control character counterparts (with the exception of C-a a; see below), thus, C-a c as well as C-a C-c can
       be used to create a window. See section CUSTOMIZATION for a description of the command.

       The following table shows the default key bindings. The trailing commas in boxes with multiple keystroke entries are separators, not part of  the
       bindings.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-a '              (select)          Prompt  for a window name or number to

                                            ously.  Note  that  this  binding  de-
                                            faults  to the command character typed
                                            twice,  unless  overridden.   For  in-
                                            stance,  if  you  use the option -e]x,

CUSTOMIZATION
       The socket directory defaults either to $HOME/.screen or simply to /tmp/screens or preferably to /run/screen chosen at compile-time. If screen is
       installed setuid-root, then the administrator should compile screen with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If screen is not running
       setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700 directory in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.

       When  screen  is  invoked,  it executes initialization commands from the files /etc/screenrc and defaults that can be overridden in the following
       ways: for the global screenrc file screen searches for the environment variable $SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may be disabled  at  compile-
       time).  The  user  specific  screenrc  file is searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.  The command line option -c takes precedence over the
       above user screenrc files.

       Commands in these files are used to set options, bind functions to keys, and to automatically establish one or more windows at the  beginning  of
       your  screen  session.  Commands are listed one per line, with empty lines being ignored.  A command's arguments are separated by tabs or spaces,
       and may be surrounded by single or double quotes.  A `#' turns the rest of the line into a comment, except in quotes.  Unintelligible  lines  are
       warned  about and ignored.  Commands may contain references to environment variables. The syntax is the shell-like "$VAR " or "${VAR}". Note that
       this causes incompatibility with previous screen versions, as now the '$'-character has to be protected with  '\'  if  no  variable  substitution
       shall be performed. A string in single-quotes is also protected from variable substitution.

       Two  configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen distribution: etc/screenrc and etc/etcscreenrc. They contain a number of useful
       examples for various commands.

       Customization can also be done 'on-line'. To enter the command mode type `C-a :'. Note that commands starting with  def  change  default  values,
       while others change current settings.

       The following commands are available:

       acladd usernames [crypted-pw]

       addacl usernames

       Enable users to fully access this screen session. Usernames can be one user or a comma separated list of users. This command enables to attach to
       the screen session and performs the equivalent of `aclchg usernames +rwx "#?"'.  executed. To add a user with restricted access, use the `aclchg'
       command  below.   If  an  optional  second parameter is supplied, it should be a crypted password for the named user(s). `Addacl' is a synonym to
       `acladd'.  Multi user mode only.

       aclchg usernames permbits list

       chacl usernames permbits list

       Change permissions for a comma separated list of users. Permission bits are represented as `r', `w' and `x'. Prefixing `+' grants the permission,
       `-'  removes it. The third parameter is a comma separated list of commands and/or windows (specified either by number or title). The special list
       `#' refers to all windows, `?' to all commands. if usernames consists of a single `*', all known users are affected.

       A command can be executed when the user has the `x' bit for it.  The user can type input to a window when he has its `w' bit  set  and  no  other
       user  obtains  a  writelock for this window.  Other bits are currently ignored.  To withdraw the writelock from another user in window 2: `aclchg
       username -w+w 2'.  To allow read-only access to the session: `aclchg username -w "#"'. As soon as a user's name is known to screen he can  attach
       to  the  session  and  (per default) has full permissions for all command and windows. Execution permission for the acl commands, `at' and others
       should also be removed or the user may be able to regain write permission.  Rights of the special username nobody cannot be changed (see  the  su
       command).  `Chacl' is a synonym to `aclchg'.  Multi user mode only.

       acldel username

       Remove  a  user from screen's access control list. If currently attached, all the user's displays are detached from the session. He cannot attach
       again.  Multi user mode only.

       aclgrp username [groupname]

       Creates groups of users that share common access rights. The name of the group is the username of the group leader. Each member of the group  in-
       herits  the  permissions  that  are granted to the group leader. That means, if a user fails an access check, another check is made for the group
       leader.  A user is removed from all groups the special value none is used for groupname.  If the second parameter is omitted all groups the  user
       is in are listed.

       aclumask [[ users ] +bits | [ users ] -bits... ]

       umask [[ users ] +bits | [ users ] -bits... ]

       This  specifies  the access other users have to windows that will be created by the caller of the command.  Users may be no, one or a comma sepa-
       rated list of known usernames. If no users are specified, a list of all currently known users is assumed.  Bits is any combination of access con-
       trol  bits  allowed defined with the aclchg command. The special username ? predefines the access that not yet known users will be granted to any
       window initially.  The special username ?? predefines the access that not yet known users are granted to any  command.   Rights  of  the  special
       username nobody cannot be changed (see the su command).  `Umask' is a synonym to `aclumask'.

       activity message

       When  any  activity  occurs in a background window that is being monitored, screen displays a notification in the message line.  The notification
       message can be re-defined by means of the activity command.  Each occurrence of `%' in message is replaced by the number of the window  in  which
       activity has occurred, and each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).  The default
       message is

                       'Activity in window %n'

       Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default, but can be altered by use of the monitor command (C-a M).

       allpartial [ on | off ]

       If set to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed on window change.  This affects all windows and is useful for slow  terminal  lines.  The
       previous setting of full/partial refresh for each window is restored with allpartial off.  This is a global flag that immediately takes effect on
       all windows overriding the partial settings. It does not change the default redraw behavior of newly created windows.

       altscreen [ on | off ]

       If set to on, "alternate screen" support is enabled in virtual terminals, just like in xterm.  Initial setting is `off'.

       at [identifier][#|*|%] command [args ... ]

       Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it had been entered there.  At changes the context (the `current window'  or  `current  dis-
       play'  setting)  of the command. If the first parameter describes a non-unique context, the command will be executed multiple times. If the first
       parameter is of the form `identifier*' then identifier is matched against user names.  The command is executed once for each display of  the  se-
       lected  user(s).  If  the  first parameter is of the form `identifier%' identifier is matched against displays. Displays are named after the ttys
       they attach. The prefix `/dev/' or `/dev/tty' may be omitted from the identifier.  If identifier has a `#' or  nothing  appended  it  is  matched
       against  window  numbers  and titles. Omitting an identifier in front of the `#', `*' or `%'-character selects all users, displays or windows be-
       cause a prefix-match is performed. Note that on the affected display(s) a short message will describe what happened. Permission  is  checked  for
       initiator of the at command, not for the owners of the affected display(s).  Note that the '#' character works as a comment introducer when it is
       preceded by whitespace. This can be escaped by prefixing a '\'.  Permission is checked for the initiator of the at command, not for the owners of
       the affected display(s).

       Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is executed at least once per window. Commands that change the internal arrangement of windows
       (like other) may be called again. In shared windows the command will be repeated for each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle  commands
       like  login!   Some  commands (e.g. process) require that a display is associated with the target windows.  These commands may not work correctly
       under at looping over windows.

       attrcolor attrib [attribute/color-modifier]

       This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the color of the text. If the attribute attrib  is  in  use,  the  specified  attri-
       bute/color  modifier  is  also applied. If no modifier is given, the current one is deleted. See the STRING ESCAPES chapter for the syntax of the
       modifier. Screen understands two pseudo-attributes, i stands for high-intensity foreground color and I for high-intensity background color.

       Examples:

              attrcolor b "R"

       Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed.

              attrcolor u "-u b"

       Use blue text instead of underline.

              attrcolor b ".I"

       Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do this already.

              attrcolor i "+b"

       Make bright colored text also bold.

       autodetach [ on | off ]

       Sets whether screen will automatically detach upon hangup, which saves all your running programs until they are resumed with a screen -r command.
       When turned off, a hangup signal will terminate screen and all the processes it contains. Autodetach is on by default.

       autonuke [ on | off ]

       Sets whether a clear screen sequence should nuke all the output that has not been written to the terminal. See also obuflimit.

       backtick id lifespan autorefresh cmd args...

       backtick id

       Program the backtick command with the numerical id id.  The output of such a command is used for substitution of the %` string escape. The speci-
       fied lifespan is the number of seconds the output is considered valid. After this time, the command is run again if a corresponding string escape
       is  encountered.   The  autorefresh parameter triggers an automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after the specified number of sec-
       onds. Only the last line of output is used for substitution.

       If both the lifespan and the autorefresh parameters are zero, the backtick program is expected to stay in the background and generate output once
       in  a  while.  In this case, the command is executed right away and screen stores the last line of output. If a new line gets printed screen will
       automatically refresh the hardstatus or the captions.

       The second form of the command deletes the backtick command with the numerical id id.

       bce [ on | off ]

       Change background-color-erase setting. If bce is set to on, all characters cleared by an erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will be displayed in
       the current background color. Otherwise the default background color is used.

       bell_msg [message]

       When a bell character is sent to a background window, screen displays a notification in the message line.  The notification message can be re-de-
       fined by this command.  Each occurrence of `%' in message is replaced by the number of the window to which a bell has been sent, and each  occur-
       rence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).  The default message is

                       'Bell in window %n'

       An empty message can be supplied to the bell_msg command to suppress output of a message line (bell_msg "").  Without parameter, the current mes-
       sage is shown.

       bind [class] key [command [args]]

       Bind a command to a key.  By default, most of the commands provided by screen are bound to one or more keys as indicated in the DEFAULT KEY BIND-
       INGS  section,  e.g.  the command to create a new window is bound to C-c and c.  The bind command can be used to redefine the key bindings and to
       define new bindings.  The key argument is either a single character, a two-character sequence of the form ^x (meaning C-x), a backslash  followed
       by  an  octal number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed by a second character, such as \^ or \\.  The argument
       can also be quoted, if you like.  If no further argument is given, any previously established binding for this key is removed.  The command argu-
       ment can be any command listed in this section.

       If a command class is specified via the -c option, the key is bound for the specified class. Use the command command to activate a class. Command
       classes can be used to create multiple command keys or multi-character bindings.

       Some examples:

                       bind ' ' windows
                       bind ^k
                       bind k
                       bind K kill
                       bind ^f screen telnet foobar
                       bind \033 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su

       would bind the space key to the command that displays a list of windows (so that the command usually invoked by C-a C-w would also  be  available
       as  C-a  space).  The  next three lines remove the default kill binding from C-a C-k and C-a k.  C-a K is then bound to the kill command. Then it
       binds C-f to the command create a window with a TELNET connection to foobar, and bind escape to the command that creates an non-login window with
       a.k.a. root in slot #9, with a superuser shell and a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.

                       bind -c demo1 0 select 10
                       bind -c demo1 1 select 11
                       bind -c demo1 2 select 12
                       bindkey "^B" command -c demo1

       makes C-b 0 select window 10, C-b 1 window 11, etc.

                       bind -c demo2 0 select 10
                       bind -c demo2 1 select 11
                       bind -c demo2 2 select 12
                       bind - command -c demo2

       makes C-a - 0 select window 10, C-a - 1 window 11, etc.

       bindkey [-d] [-m] [-a] [[-k|-t] string [cmd-args]]

       This command manages screen's input translation tables. Every entry in one of the tables tells screen how to react if a certain sequence of char-
       acters is encountered. There are three tables: one that should contain actions programmed by the user, one for the default actions used for  ter-
       minal emulation and one for screen's copy mode to do cursor movement. See section INPUT TRANSLATION for a list of default key bindings.

       If the -d option is given, bindkey modifies the default table, -m changes the copy mode table and with neither option the user table is selected.
       The argument string is the sequence of characters to which an action is bound. This can either be a fixed string or a termcap keyboard capability
       name (selectable with the -k option).

       Some  keys on a VT100 terminal can send a different string if application mode is turned on (e.g the cursor keys).  Such keys have two entries in
       the translation table. You can select the application mode entry by specifying the -a option.

       The -t option tells screen not to do inter-character timing. One cannot turn off the timing if a termcap capability is used.

       Cmd can be any of screen's commands with an arbitrary number of args.  If cmd is omitted the key-binding is removed from the table.

       Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:

               bindkey -d

       Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode entries are marked with [A].

               bindkey -k k1 select 1

       Make the "F1" key switch to window one.

               bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo

       Make "foo" an abbreviation of the word "barfoo". Timeout is disabled so that users can type slowly.

               bindkey "\024" mapdefault

       This key-binding makes ^T an escape character for key-bindings. If you did the above stuff barfoo binding, you can enter the word foo  by  typing
       ^Tfoo. If you want to insert a ^T you have to press the key twice (i.e., escape the escape binding).

               bindkey -k F1 command

       Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape (besides ^A).

       break [duration]

       Send  a  break signal for duration*0.25 seconds to this window.  For non-Posix systems the time interval may be rounded up to full seconds.  Most
       useful if a character device is attached to the window rather than a shell process (See also chapter WINDOW TYPES). The  maximum  duration  of  a
       break signal is limited to 15 seconds.

       blanker

       Activate  the  screen blanker. First the screen is cleared. If no blanker program is defined, the cursor is turned off, otherwise, the program is
       started and it's output is written to the screen.  The screen blanker is killed with the first keypress, the read key is discarded.

       This command is normally used together with the idle command.

       blankerprg [program-args]

       Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program if an empty argument is given. Shows the currently set blanker program  if  no  arguments
       are given.

       breaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK|TCSBRK]

       Choose  one  of the available methods of generating a break signal for terminal devices. This command should affect the current window only.  But
       it still behaves identical to defbreaktype. This will be changed in the future.  Calling breaktype with no parameter displays  the  break  method
       for the current window.

       bufferfile [exchange-file]

       Change  the  filename used for reading and writing with the paste buffer.  If the optional argument to the bufferfile command is omitted, the de-
       fault setting (/tmp/screen-exchange) is reactivated.  The following example will paste the system's password file into the screen  window  (using
       the paste buffer, where a copy remains):

                       C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd
                       C-a < C-a ]
                       C-a : bufferfile

       bumpleft

       Swaps window with previous one on window list.

       bumpright

       Swaps window with next one on window list.

       c1 [ on | off ]

       Change c1 code processing. C1 on tells screen to treat the input characters between 128 and 159 as control functions.  Such an 8-bit code is nor-
       mally the same as ESC followed by the corresponding 7-bit code. The default setting is to process c1 codes and can be changed with the defc1 com-
       mand.  Users with fonts that have usable characters in the c1 positions may want to turn this off.

       caption [ top | bottom ] always|splitonly[string]

       caption string [string]

       This  command controls the display of the window captions. Normally a caption is only used if more than one window is shown on the display (split
       screen mode). But if the type is set to always screen shows a caption even if only one window is displayed. The default is splitonly.

       The second form changes the text used for the caption. You can use all escapes from the STRING ESCAPES chapter. Screen uses  a  default  of  `%3n
       %t'.

       You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional argument.

       You can have the caption displayed either at the top or bottom of the window.  The default is bottom.

       charset set

       Change  the current character set slot designation and charset mapping.  The first four character of set are treated as charset designators while
       the fifth and sixth character must be in range '0' to '3' and set the GL/GR charset mapping. On every position a '.' may be used to indicate that
       the  corresponding  charset/mapping  should not be changed (set is padded to six characters internally by appending '.'  chars). New windows have
       "BBBB02" as default charset, unless a encoding command is active.
       The current setting can be viewed with the info command.

       chdir [directory]

       Change the current directory of screen to the specified directory or, if called without an argument, to your home directory (the value of the en-
       vironment variable $HOME).  All windows that are created by means of the screen command from within .screenrc or by means of C-a : screen ...  or
       C-a c use this as their default directory.  Without a chdir command, this would be the directory from which screen was invoked.

       Hardcopy and log files are always written to the window's default directory, not the current directory of the process running in the window.  You
       can  use  this  command multiple times in your .screenrc to start various windows in different default directories, but the last chdir value will
       affect all the windows you create interactively.

       cjkwidth [ on | off ]

       Treat ambiguous width characters as full/half width.

       clear

       Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback buffer.

       collapse

       Reorders window on window list, removing number gaps between them.

       colon [prefix]

       Allows you to enter .screenrc command lines. Useful for on-the-fly modification of key bindings, specific window creation and changing  settings.
       Note  that  the  set keyword no longer exists! Usually commands affect the current window rather than default settings for future windows. Change
       defaults with commands starting with 'def...'.

       If you consider this as the `Ex command mode' of screen, you may regard C-a esc (copy mode) as its `Vi command mode'.

       command [ -c class"]"

       This command has the same effect as typing the screen escape character (^A). It is probably only useful for key bindings.  If the  -c  option  is
       given, select the specified command class.  See also bind and bindkey.

       compacthist [ on | off ]

       This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines when scrolling up text into the history buffer.

       console [ on | off ]

       Grabs  or  un-grabs  the machines console output to a window.  Note: Only the owner of /dev/console can grab the console output.  This command is
       only available if the machine supports the ioctl TIOCCONS.

       copy

       Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text from the current window and its history into the paste buffer. In this  mode  a  vi-like
       `full screen editor' is active:
       The editor's movement keys are:

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       h, C-h,        move the cursor left.
       left arrow
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       j, C-n,        move the cursor down.
       down arrow
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       k, C-p,        move the cursor up.
       up arrow
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       l ('el'),      move the cursor right.
       right arrow
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       0 (zero) C-a   move to the leftmost column.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       + and -        positions one line up and down.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       H, M and L     move  the cursor to the leftmost column of the top,
                      center or bottom line of the window.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       |              moves to the specified absolute column.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       g or home      moves to the beginning of the buffer.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       G or end       moves to the specified absolute line (default:  end
                      of buffer).
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       %              jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       ^ or $         move  to  the leftmost column, to the first or last
                      non-whitespace character on the line.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       w, b, and e    move the cursor word by word.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       B, E           move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi).
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

       f/F, t/T       move the cursor forward/backward to the next occur-
                      rence  of the target. (eg, '3fy' will move the cur-
                      sor to the 3rd 'y' to the right.)
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       ; and ,        Repeat the last f/F/t/T command in  the  same/oppo-
                      site direction.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-e and C-y    scroll  the  display up/down by one line while pre-
                      serving the cursor position.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-u and C-d    scroll the display up/down by the specified  amount
                      of lines while preserving the cursor position. (De-
                      fault: half screen-full).
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-b and C-f    scroll the display up/down a full screen.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

       Note: Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a .screenrc command.  (E.g. markkeys "h=^B:l=^F:$=^E") There is no simple method for a  full
       emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-character codes.

       Some keys are defined to do mark and replace operations.

       The copy range is specified by setting two marks. The text between these marks will be highlighted. Press:

              space or enter to set the first or second mark respectively. If mousetrack is set to `on', marks can also be set using left mouse click.

              Y and y used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of line.

              W marks exactly one word.

       Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count number by pressing digits

              0..9 which is taken as a repeat count.

       Example: C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y will copy lines 11 to 15 into the paste buffer.

       The following search keys are defined:

              / Vi-like search forward.

              ? Vi-like search backward.

              C-a s Emacs style incremental search forward.

              C-r Emacs style reverse i-search.

              n Find next search pattern.

              N Find previous search pattern.

       There are however some keys that act differently than in vi.  Vi does not allow one to yank rectangular blocks of text, but screen does. Press: c
       or C to set the left or right margin respectively. If no repeat count is given, both default to the current cursor position.

       Example: Try this on a rather full text screen:

              C-a [ M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE.

       This moves one to the middle line of the screen, moves in 20 columns left, marks the beginning of the paste buffer, sets the left column, moves 5
       columns down, sets the right column, and then marks the end of the paste buffer. Now try:

              C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE

       and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.

       J joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated by a newline character (012), lines glued seamless, lines separated by a single white-
       space and comma separated lines. Note that you can prepend the newline character with a carriage return character, by issuing a crlf on.

       v or V is for all the vi users with :set numbers - it toggles the left margin between column 9 and 1. Press

       a before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus the contents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten, but is appended to.

       A toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark.

       > sets the (second) mark and writes the contents of the paste buffer to the screen-exchange file (/tmp/screen-exchange per  default)  once  copy-
       mode is finished.

       This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer to that file: C-A [ g SPACE G $ >.

       C-g gives information about the current line and column.

       x or o exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position. You can use this to adjust an already placed mark.

       C-l ('el') will redraw the screen.

       @ does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode.

       All keys not described here exit copy mode.

       copy_reg [key]

       No longer exists, use readreg instead.

       crlf [ on | off ]

       This  affects  the  copying of text regions with the `C-a [' command. If it is set to `on', lines will be separated by the two character sequence
       `CR' - `LF'.  Otherwise (default) only `LF' is used.  When no parameter is given, the state is toggled.

       debug [ on | off ]

       Turns runtime debugging on or off. If screen has been compiled with option -DDEBUG debugging available and is turned on per  default.  Note  that
       this  command  only  affects debugging output from the main SCREEN process correctly. Debug output from attacher processes can only be turned off
       once and forever.

       defc1 [ on | off ]

       Same as the c1 command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `on'.

       defautonuke [ on | off ]

       Same as the autonuke command except that the default setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is `off'.  Note that you  can  use  the
       special `AN' terminal capability if you want to have a dependency on the terminal type.

       defbce [ on | off ]

       Same as the bce command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defbreaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK|TCSBRK]

       Choose  one  of the available methods of generating a break signal for terminal devices. The preferred methods are tcsendbreak and TIOCSBRK.  The
       third, TCSBRK, blocks the complete screen session for the duration of the break, but it may be the only way to generate long breaks.  Tcsendbreak
       and TIOCSBRK may or may not produce long breaks with spikes (e.g. 4 per second). This is not only system-dependent, this also differs between se-
       rial board drivers.  Calling defbreaktype with no parameter displays the current setting.

       defcharset [set]

       Like the charset command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Shows current default if called without argument.

       defdynamictitle [ on | off ]

       Set default behaviour for new windows regarding if screen should change window title when seeing proper escape sequence. See also "TITLES (naming
       windows)" section.

       defescape xy

       Set the default command characters. This is equivalent to the escape except that it is useful multiuser sessions only. In a multiuser session es-
       cape changes the command character of the calling user, where defescape changes the default command characters  for  users  that  will  be  added
       later.

       defflow [ on | off | auto [ interrupt ]]

       Same  as  the flow command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `auto'.  Specifying defflow auto inter-
       rupt is the same as the command-line options -fa and -i.

       defgr [ on | off ]

       Same as the gr command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defhstatus [status]

       The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set to status.  This command is useful to make the hardstatus of every  window  display  the
       window number or title or the like.  Status may contain the same directives as in the window messages, but the directive escape character is '^E'
       (octal 005) instead of '%'.  This was done to make a misinterpretation of program generated hardstatus lines impossible.  If the parameter status
       is omitted, the current default string is displayed.  Per default the hardstatus line of new windows is empty.

       defencoding enc

       Same as the encoding command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is the encoding taken from the terminal.

       deflog [ on | off ]

       Same as the log command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       deflogin [ on | off ]

       Same  as  the  login  command  except that the default setting for new windows is changed. This is initialized with `on' as distributed (see con-
       fig.h.in).

       defmode mode

       The mode of each newly allocated pseudo-tty is set to mode.  Mode is an octal number.  When no defmode command is given, mode 0622 is used.

       defmonitor [ on | off]

       Same as the monitor command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defmousetrack [ on | off ]

       Same as the mousetrack command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defnonblock [ on | off | numsecs]

       Same as the nonblock command except that the default setting for displays is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defobuflimit limit

       Same as the obuflimit command except that the default setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is 256 bytes.  Note that you  can  use
       the special 'OL' terminal capability if you want to have a dependency on the terminal type.

       defscrollback num

       Same as the scrollback command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is 100.

       defshell command

       Synonym to the shell .screenrc command. See there.

       defsilence [ on | off ]

       Same as the silence command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.

       defslowpaste msec

       Same as the slowpaste command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is 0 milliseconds, meaning `off'.

       defutf8 [ on | off ]

       Same  as the utf8 command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `on' if screen was started with -U, oth-
       erwise `off'.

       defwrap [ on | off ]

       Same as the wrap command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initially line-wrap is on and can be toggled with  the  wrap
       command (C-a r) or by means of "C-a : wrap on|off".

       defwritelock [ on | off | auto ]

       Same as the writelock command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initially writelocks will off.

       detach [-h]

       Detach  the  screen  session  (disconnect  it from the terminal and put it into the background).  This returns you to the shell where you invoked
       screen.  A detached screen can be resumed by invoking screen with the -r option (see also section COMMAND-LINE  OPTIONS).  The  -h  option  tells
       screen to immediately close the connection to the terminal (hangup).

       dinfo

       Show what screen thinks about your terminal. Useful if you want to know why features like color or the alternate charset don't work.

       displays

       Shows  a  tabular listing of all currently connected user front-ends (displays).  This is most useful for multiuser sessions.  The following keys
       can be used in displays list:

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       k, C-p, or up           Move up one line.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       j, C-n, or down         Move down one line.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-a or home             Move to the first line.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-e or end              Move to the last line.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-u or C-d              Move one half page up or down.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-b or C-f              Move one full page up or down.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       mouseclick              Move to the selected line.  Available  when  mouse-
                               track is set to on.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       space                   Refresh the list
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       d                       Detach that display
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       D                       Power detach that display
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-g, enter, or escape   Exit the list
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The following is an example of what displays could look like:
              xterm 80x42 jnweiger@/dev/ttyp4     0(m11)   &rWx
              facit 80x24 mlschroe@/dev/ttyhf nb 11(tcsh)   rwx
              xterm 80x42 jnhollma@/dev/ttyp5     0(m11)   &R.x
               (A)   (B)     (C)     (D)     (E) (F)(G)   (H)(I)

       The legend is as follows:

              (A) The terminal type known by screen for this display.

              (B) Displays geometry as width x height.

              (C) Username who is logged in at the display.

              (D) Device name of the display or the attached device

              (E) Display is in blocking or nonblocking mode.  The available modes are "nb", "NB", "Z<", "Z>", and "BL".

              (F) Number of the window

              (G) Name/title of window

              (H) Whether the window is shared

              (I) Window permissions. Made up of three characters.

              displays needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 5 characters high in order to display.

       digraph [preset[unicode-value]]

       This  command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two characters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the resulting character
       is inserted in the input stream. For example, if the user enters 'a"', an a-umlaut will be inserted. If  the  first  character  entered  is  a  0
       (zero), screen will treat the following characters (up to three) as an octal number instead.  The optional argument preset is treated as user in-
       put, thus one can create an umlaut key.  For example the command "bindkey ^K digraph '"'" enables the user to  generate  an  a-umlaut  by  typing
       CTRL-K  a.   When a non-zero unicode-value is specified, a new digraph is created with the specified preset. The digraph is unset if a zero value
       is provided for the unicode-value.

       dumptermcap

       Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal optimized for the currently active window to the file .termcap in the user's  $HOME/.screen  di-
       rectory  (or  wherever  screen stores its sockets. See the FILES section below).  This termcap entry is identical to the value of the environment
       variable $TERMCAP that is set up by screen for each window. For terminfo based systems you will need to run a converter like captoinfo  and  then
       compile the entry with tic.

       dynamictitle [ on | off ]

       Change  behaviour  for  windows  regarding if screen should change window title when seeing proper escape sequence. See also "TITLES (naming win-
       dows)" section.

       echo [-n] message

       The echo command may be used to annoy screen users with a 'message of the day'. Typically installed in a global /etc/screenrc.  The option -n may
       be used to suppress the line feed.  See also sleep.  Echo is also useful for online checking of environment variables.

       encoding enc [enc]

       Tell  screen  how  to interpret the input/output. The first argument sets the encoding of the current window. Each window can emulate a different
       encoding. The optional second parameter overwrites the encoding of the connected terminal. It should never be needed as screen  uses  the  locale
       setting to detect the encoding.  There is also a way to select a terminal encoding depending on the terminal type by using the KJ termcap entry.

       Supported  encodings  are  eucJP,  SJIS,  eucKR,  eucCN,  Big5,  GBK,  KOI8-R, KOI8-U, CP1251, UTF-8, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5,
       ISO8859-6, ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.

       See also defencoding, which changes the default setting of a new window.

       escape xy

       Set the command character to x and the character generating a literal command character (by triggering the meta command) to y (similar to the  -e
       option).   Each  argument  is  either a single character, a two-character sequence of the form ^x (meaning C-x), a backslash followed by an octal
       number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed by a second character, such as \^ or \\.  The default is ^Aa.

       eval command1[command2 ...]

       Parses and executes each argument as separate command.

       exec [[fdpat]newcommand [args ...]]

       Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path newcommand and its optional arguments) in the current window. The  flow  of  data  between
       newcommands  stdin/stdout/stderr,  the process originally started in the window (let us call it "application-process") and screen itself (window)
       is controlled by the file descriptor pattern fdpat.  This pattern is basically a three character sequence representing stdin, stdout  and  stderr
       of  newcommand.  A dot (.) connects the file descriptor to screen.  An exclamation mark (!) causes the file descriptor to be connected to the ap-
       plication-process. A colon (:) combines both.  User input will go to newcommand unless newcommand receives the application-process'  output  (fd-
       pats first character is `!' or `:') or a pipe symbol (|) is added (as a fourth character) to the end of fdpat.

       Invoking  `exec' without arguments shows name and arguments of the currently running subprocess in this window. Only one subprocess a time can be
       running in each window.

       When a subprocess is running the `kill' command will affect it instead of the windows process.

       Refer to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps' for a confusing illustration of all 21 possible combinations. Each drawing  shows  the  digits  2,1,0
       representing  the  three  file descriptors of newcommand. The box marked `W' is the usual pty that has the application-process on its slave side.
       The box marked `P' is the secondary pty that now has screen at its master side.

       Abbreviations: Whitespace between the word `exec' and fdpat and the command can be omitted. Trailing dots and a fdpat consisting only of dots can
       be omitted. A simple `|' is synonymous for the pattern `!..|'; the word exec can be omitted here and can always be replaced by `!'.

       Examples:

              exec ... /bin/sh

              exec /bin/sh

              !/bin/sh

                     Creates  another  shell  in the same window, while the original shell is still running. Output of both shells is displayed and user
                     input is sent to the new /bin/sh.

              exec !.. stty 19200

              exec ! stty 19200

              !!stty 19200

                     Set the speed of the window's tty. If your stty command operates on stdout, then add another `!'.

              exec !..| less

              |less

                     This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|' is needed to give the user control over  the  pager  although  it
                     gets its input from the window's process. This works, because less listens on stderr (a behavior that screen would not expect with-
                     out the `|') when its stdin is not a tty.  Less versions newer than 177 fail miserably here; good old pg still works.

              !:sed -n s/.*Error.*/\007/p

                     Sends window output to both, the user and the sed command. The sed inserts an additional bell character (oct. 007)  to  the  window
                     output seen by screen.  This will cause "Bell in window x" messages, whenever the string "Error" appears in the window.

       fit

       Change  the  window  size to the size of the current region. This command is needed because screen doesn't adapt the window size automatically if
       the window is displayed more than once.

       flow [ on | off | auto]

       Sets the flow-control mode for this window.  Without parameters it cycles the current window's flow-control setting from "automatic" to  "on"  to
       "off".   See  the  discussion  on  FLOW-CONTROL later on in this document for full details and note, that this is subject to change in future re-
       leases.  Default is set by `defflow'.

       focus [ next | prev | up | down | left | right | top | bottom ]

       Move the input focus to the next region. This is done in a cyclic way so that the top left region is selected after the bottom right one.  If  no
       option is given it defaults to `next'. The next region to be selected is determined by how the regions are layered.  Normally, the next region in
       the same layer would be selected.  However, if that next region contains one or more layers, the first region in the highest  layer  is  selected
       first.  If you are at the last region of the current layer, `next' will move the focus to the next region in the lower layer (if there is a lower
       layer).  `Prev' cycles in the opposite order. See split for more information about layers.

       The rest of the options (`up', `down', `left', `right', `top', and `bottom') are more indifferent to layers. The option `up' will move the  focus
       upward  to the region that is touching the upper left corner of the current region.  `Down' will move downward to the region that is touching the
       lower left corner of the current region. The option `left' will move the focus leftward to the region that is touching the upper left  corner  of
       the  current  region,  while `right' will move rightward to the region that is touching the upper right corner of the current region. Moving left
       from a left most region or moving right from a right most region will result in no action.

       The option `top' will move the focus to the very first region in the upper list corner of the screen, and `bottom' will move to the region in the
       bottom right corner of the screen. Moving up from a top most region or moving down from a bottom most region will result in no action.

       Useful bindings are (h, j, k, and l as in vi)
           bind h focus left
           bind j focus down
           bind k focus up
           bind l focus right
           bind t focus top
           bind b focus bottom
       Note that k is traditionally bound to the kill command.

       focusminsize [ ( width|max|_ ) ( height|max|_ ) ]

       This  forces any currently selected region to be automatically resized at least a certain width and height. All other surrounding regions will be
       resized in order to accommodate.  This constraint follows every time the focus command is used. The resize command can be used to increase either
       dimension  of  a region, but never below what is set with focusminsize. The underscore `_' is a synonym for max. Setting a width and height of `0
       0' (zero zero) will undo any constraints and allow for manual resizing.  Without any parameters, the minimum width and height is shown.

       gr [ on | off ]

       Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input character with the 8th bit set, it will use the charset stored in the GR slot and
       print the character with the 8th bit stripped. The default (see also defgr) is not to process GR switching because otherwise the ISO88591 charset
       would not work.

       group [grouptitle]

       Change or show the group the current window belongs to. Windows can be moved around between different groups by specifying the name of the desti-
       nation group. Without specifying a group, the title of the current group is displayed.

       hardcopy [-h] [file]

       Writes  out  the  currently displayed image to the file file, or, if no filename is specified, to hardcopy.n in the default directory, where n is
       the number of the current window.  This either appends or overwrites the file if it exists. See below.  If the option -h is specified, dump  also
       the contents of the scrollback buffer.

       hardcopy_append [ on | off ]

       If  set to "on", screen will append to the "hardcopy.n" files created by the command C-a h, otherwise these files are overwritten each time.  De-
       fault is `off'.

       hardcopydir directory

       Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If unset, hardcopys are dumped in screen's current working directory.

       hardstatus [ on | off ]

       hardstatus [ always ] firstline | lastline | message | ignore [ string ]

       hardstatus string [ string ]

       This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal's hardstatus line. The first form toggles whether screen will use the hardware sta-
       tus  line  to  display  messages. If the flag is set to `off', these messages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The default
       setting is `on'.

       The second form tells screen what to do if the terminal doesn't have a hardstatus line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities "hs",  "ts",  "fs"
       and  "ds" are not set).  When firstline/lastline is used, screen will reserve the first/last line of the display for the hardstatus. message uses
       screen's message mechanism and ignore tells screen never to display the hardstatus.  If you prepend the  word  always  to  the  type  (e.g.,  al-
       wayslastline), screen will use the type even if the terminal supports a hardstatus.

       The  third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus line.  '%h' is used as default string, i.e., the stored hardstatus of the current window
       (settable via ESC]0;<string>^G or ESC_<string>ESC\) is displayed.  You can customize this to any string you like including the escapes  from  the
       STRING ESCAPES chapter. If you leave out the argument string, the current string is displayed.

       You can mix the second and third form by providing the string as additional argument.

       height [-w|-d] [lines [cols]]

       Set the display height to a specified number of lines. When no argument is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines display. You can also specify
       a width if you want to change both values.  The -w option tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size, -d  vice
       versa.

       help[class]

       Not  really  a online help, but displays a help screen showing you all the key bindings.  The first pages list all the internal commands followed
       by their current bindings.  Subsequent pages will display the custom commands, one command per key.  Press space when you're  done  reading  each
       page, or return to exit early.  All other characters are ignored. If the -c option is given, display all bound commands for the specified command
       class.  See also DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS section.

       history

       Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access to previous commands.  For example csh has the command !! to repeat the last command exe-
       cuted.   Screen  allows  you  to have a primitive way of re-calling the command that started ...: You just type the first letter of that command,
       then hit `C-a {' and screen tries to find a previous line that matches with the `prompt character' to the left of the cursor. This line is pasted
       into this window's input queue.  Thus you have a crude command history (made up by the visible window and its scrollback buffer).

       hstatus status

       Change the window's hardstatus line to the string status.

       idle [timeout[cmd-args]]

       Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds inactivity is reached. This command will normally be the blanker command to cre-
       ate a screen blanker, but it can be any screen command.  If no command is specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero (or  the  special
       timeout off) disables the timer.  If no arguments are given, the current settings are displayed.

       ignorecase [ on | off ]

       Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in searches. Default is `off'. Without any options, the state of ignorecase is toggled.

       info

       Uses the message line to display some information about the current window: the cursor position in the form (column,row) starting with (1,1), the
       terminal width and height plus the size of the scrollback buffer in lines, like in (80,24)+50, the current state of window XON/XOFF flow  control
       is shown like this (See also section FLOW CONTROL):

       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |+flow    | automatic flow control, currently on.                    |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |-flow    | automatic flow control, currently off.                   |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |+(+)flow | flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic control.     |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |-(+)flow | flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control. |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |+(-)flow | flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.  |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       |-(-)flow | flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic control.    |
       +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
       The  current line wrap setting (`+wrap' indicates enabled, `-wrap' not) is also shown. The flags `ins', `org', `app', `log', `mon' or `nored' are
       displayed when the window is in insert mode, origin mode, application-keypad mode, has output logging, activity monitoring or partial redraw  en-
       abled.

       The  currently  active  character  set (G0, G1, G2, or G3) and in square brackets the terminal character sets that are currently designated as G0
       through G3 is shown. If the window is in UTF-8 mode, the string UTF-8 is shown instead.

       Additional modes depending on the type of the window are displayed at the end of the status line (See also chapter WINDOW TYPES).

       If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default state, the info line is started with a string identifying the current state.

       For system information use the time command.

       ins_reg [key]

       No longer exists, use paste instead.

       kill

       Kill current window.

       If there is an `exec' command running then it is killed. Otherwise the process (shell) running in the window receives  a  HANGUP  condition,  the
       window structure is removed and screen (your display) switches to another window.  When the last window is destroyed, screen exits.  After a kill
       screen switches to the previously displayed window.

       Note: Emacs users should keep this command in mind, when killing a line.  It is recommended not to use C-a as the screen escape key or to  rebind
       kill to C-a K.

       lastmsg

       Redisplay  the last contents of the message/status line.  Useful if you're typing when a message appears, because  the message goes away when you
       press a key (unless your terminal has a hardware status line).  Refer to the commands msgwait and msgminwait for fine tuning.

       layout new [title]

       Create a new layout. The screen will change to one whole region and be switched to the blank window. From here, you build  the  regions  and  the
       windows they show as you desire. The new layout will be numbered with the smallest available integer, starting with zero. You can optionally give
       a title to your new layout.  Otherwise, it will have a default title of layout. You can always change the title later by using the command layout
       title.

       layout remove [n|title]

       Remove,  or  in  other  words, delete the specified layout. Either the number or the title can be specified. Without either specification, screen
       will remove the current layout.

       Removing a layout does not affect your set windows or regions.

       layout next

       Switch to the next layout available

       layout prev

       Switch to the previous layout available

       layout select [n|title]

       Select the desired layout. Either the number or the title can be specified. Without either specification, screen will prompt and ask which screen
       is desired. To see which layouts are available, use the layout show command.

       layout show

       List on the message line the number(s) and title(s) of the available layout(s). The current layout is flagged.

       layout title [title]

       Change  or  display  the  title of the current layout. A string given will be used to name the layout. Without any options, the current title and
       number is displayed on the message line.

       layout number [n]

       Change or display the number of the current layout. An integer given will be used to number the layout. Without any options, the  current  number
       and title is displayed on the message line.

       layout attach [title|:last]

       Change or display which layout to reattach back to. The default is :last, which tells screen to reattach back to the last used layout just before
       detachment. By supplying a title, You can instruct screen to reattach to a particular layout regardless which one was used at the time of detach-
       ment. Without any options, the layout to reattach to will be shown in the message line.

       layout save [n|title]

       Remember  the  current arrangement of regions. When used, screen will remember the arrangement of vertically and horizontally split regions. This
       arrangement is restored when a screen session is reattached or switched back from a different layout. If the session ends or the  screen  process
       dies,  the layout arrangements are lost. The layout dump command should help in this siutation. If a number or title is supplied, screen will re-
       member the arrangement of that particular layout. Without any options, screen will remember the current layout.

       Saving your regions can be done automatically by using the layout autosave command.

       layout autosave [ on | off]

       Change or display the status of automatcally saving layouts. The default is on, meaning when screen is detached or changed to a different layout,
       the  arrangement  of  regions and windows will be remembered at the time of change and restored upon return.  If autosave is set to off, that ar-
       rangement will only be restored to either to the last manual save, using layout save, or to when the layout was first created, to a single region
       with a single window. Without either an on or off, the current status is displayed on the message line.

       layout dump [filename]

       Write to a file the order of splits made in the current layout. This is useful to recreate the order of your regions used in your current layout.
       Only the current layout is recorded. While the order of the regions are recorded, the sizes of those regions  and  which  windows  correspond  to
       which regions are not. If no filename is specified, the default is layout-dump, saved in the directory that the screen process was started in. If
       the file already exists, layout dump will append to that file. As an example:

                C-a : layout dump /home/user/.screenrc

       will save or append the layout to the user's .screenrc file.

       license

       Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever screen is started without options, which should be often enough. See also the  startup_message
       command.

       lockscreen

       Lock this display.  Call a screenlock program (/local/bin/lck or /usr/bin/lock or a builtin if no other is available). Screen does not accept any
       command keys until this program terminates. Meanwhile processes in the windows may continue, as the windows are  in  the  `detached'  state.  The
       screenlock  program may be changed through the environment variable $LOCKPRG (which must be set in the shell from which screen is started) and is
       executed with the user's uid and gid.

       Warning: When you leave other shells unlocked and you have no password set on screen, the lock is void: One could easily re-attach  from  an  un-
       locked shell. This feature should rather be called `lockterminal'.

       log [ on | off ]

       Start/stop  writing  output  of  the current window to a file screenlog.n in the window's default directory, where n is the number of the current
       window. This filename can be changed with the `logfile' command. If no parameter is given, the state of logging is toggled. The  session  log  is
       appended  to  the previous contents of the file if it already exists. The current contents and the contents of the scrollback history are not in-
       cluded in the session log.  Default is `off'.

       logfile filename

       logfile flush secs

       Defines the name the log files will get. The default is screenlog.%n. The second form changes the number  of  seconds  screen  will  wait  before
       flushing the logfile buffer to the file-system. The default value is 10 seconds.

       login [ on | off ]

       Adds  or  removes  the entry in the utmp database file for the current window.  This controls if the window is `logged in'.  When no parameter is
       given, the login state of the window is toggled.  Additionally to that toggle, it is convenient having a `log in' and a `log out' key. E.g. `bind
       I  login  on'  and  `bind O login off' will map these keys to be C-a I and C-a O.  The default setting (in config.h.in) should be on for a screen
       that runs under suid-root.  Use the deflogin command to change the default login state for new windows.  Both  commands  are  only  present  when
       screen has been compiled with utmp support.

       logtstamp [on|off]

       logtstamp after [secs]

       logtstamp string
       [string]

       This  command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of screen.  If time-stamps are turned on, screen adds a string containing the current time to
       the logfile after two minutes of inactivity.  When output continues and more than another two minutes have passed, a second time-stamp  is  added
       to  document  the  restart of the output. You can change this timeout with the second form of the command. The third form is used for customizing
       the time-stamp string (`-- %n:%t -- time-stamp -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\n' by default).

       mapdefault

       Tell screen that the next input character should only be looked up in the default bindkey table. See also bindkey.

       mapnotnext

       Like mapdefault, but don't even look in the default bindkey table.

       maptimeout [timeout]

       Set the inter-character timer for input sequence detection to a timeout of timeout ms. The default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments
       shows the current setting.  See also bindkey.

       markkeys string

       This  is  a method of changing the keymap used for copy/history mode.  The string is made up of oldchar=newchar pairs which are separated by `:'.
       Example: The string B=^B:F=^F will change the keys `C-b' and `C-f' to the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page).  This happens  to  be  the
       default  binding  for  `B'  and  `F'.  The command markkeys h=^B:l=^F:$=^E would set the mode for an emacs-style binding.  If your terminal sends
       characters, that cause you to abort copy mode, then this command may help by binding these characters to do nothing.  The no-op character is  `@'
       and  is used like this: markkeys @=L=H if you do not want to use the `H' or `L' commands any longer.  As shown in this example, multiple keys can
       be assigned to one function in a single statement.

       maxwin num

       Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesn't affect already existing windows. The number can be increased only when there are no ex-
       isting windows.

       meta

       Insert the command character (C-a) in the current window's input stream.

       monitor [ on | off ]

       Toggles  activity  monitoring  of windows.  When monitoring is turned on and an affected window is switched into the background, you will receive
       the activity notification message in the status line at the first sign of output and the window will also be marked with an `@'  in  the  window-
       status display.  Monitoring is initially off for all windows.

       mousetrack [ on | off ]

       This  command  determines  whether screen will watch for mouse clicks. When this command is enabled, regions that have been split in various ways
       can be selected by pointing to them with a mouse and left-clicking them. Without specifying on or off, the current state is  displayed.  The  de-
       fault state is determined by the defmousetrack command.

       msgminwait sec

       Defines the time screen delays a new message when one message is currently displayed.  The default is 1 second.

       msgwait sec

       Defines the time a message is displayed if screen is not disturbed by other activity. The default is 5 seconds.

       multiuser [ on | off ]

       Switch  between  singleuser  and  multiuser  mode.  Standard  screen  operation is singleuser. In multiuser mode the commands `acladd', `aclchg',
       `aclgrp' and `acldel' can be used to enable (and disable) other users accessing this screen session.

       nethack [ on | off ]

       Changes the kind of error messages used by screen.  When you are familiar with the game nethack, you may enjoy the nethack-style  messages  which
       will often blur the facts a little, but are much funnier to read. Anyway, standard messages often tend to be unclear as well.
       This option is only available if screen was compiled with the NETHACK flag defined. The default setting is then determined by the presence of the
       environment variable $NETHACKOPTIONS and the file ~/.nethackrc - if either one is present, the default is on.

       next

       Switch to the next window.  This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.

       nonblock [ on | off | numsecs ]

       Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays) that cease to accept output. This can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem  connec-
       tion  gets  cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is off (this is the default) screen waits until the display restarts to accept the output.
       If nonblock is on, screen waits until the timeout is reached (on is treated as 1s). If the display still doesn't receive characters, screen  will
       consider  it blocked and stop sending characters to it. If at some time it restarts to accept characters, screen will unblock the display and re-
       display the updated window contents.

       number [[+|-]n]

       Change the current window's number. If the given number n is already used by another window, both windows exchange their numbers. If no  argument
       is specified, the current window number (and title) is shown. Using `+' or `-' will change the window's number by the relative amount specified.

       obuflimit [limit]

       If  the  output buffer contains more bytes than the specified limit, no more data will be read from the windows. The default value is 256. If you
       have a fast display (like xterm), you can set it to some higher value. If no argument is specified, the current setting is displayed.

       only

       Kill all regions but the current one.

       other

       Switch to the window displayed previously. If this window does no longer exist, other has the same effect as next.

       partial [ on | off ]

       Defines whether the display should be refreshed (as with redisplay) after switching to the current window. This command only affects the  current
       window.   To  immediately  affect  all windows use the allpartial command.  Default is `off', of course.  This default is fixed, as there is cur-
       rently no defpartial command.

       password [crypted_pw]

       Present a crypted password in your .screenrc file and screen will ask for it, whenever someone attempts to resume a detached.  This is useful  if
       you  have  privileged  programs  running under screen and you want to protect your session from reattach attempts by another user masquerading as
       your uid (i.e. any superuser.)  If no crypted password is specified, screen prompts twice for typing a password and places its encryption in  the
       paste buffer.  Default is `none', this disables password checking.

       paste [registers [dest_reg]]

       Write  the  (concatenated) contents of the specified registers to the stdin queue of the current window. The register '.' is treated as the paste
       buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a single register to paste.  The paste buffer can be filled with the copy, history  and
       readbuf  commands.   Other registers can be filled with the register, readreg and paste commands.  If paste is called with a second argument, the
       contents of the specified registers is pasted into the named destination register rather than the window. If '.' is used as the second  argument,
       the displays paste buffer is the destination.  Note, that paste uses a wide variety of resources: Whenever a second argument is specified no cur-
       rent window is needed. When the source specification only contains registers (not the paste buffer) then there need  not  be  a  current  display
       (terminal attached), as the registers are a global resource. The paste buffer exists once for every user.

       pastefont [ on | off ]

       Tell  screen  to include font information in the paste buffer. The default is not to do so. This command is especially useful for multi character
       fonts like kanji.

       pow_break

       Reopen the window's terminal line and send a break condition. See `break'.

       pow_detach

       Power detach.  Mainly the same as detach, but also sends a HANGUP signal to the parent process of screen.  CAUTION: This will result in a logout,
       when screen was started from your login-shell.

       pow_detach_msg [message]

       The  message  specified  here is output whenever a `Power detach' was performed. It may be used as a replacement for a logout message or to reset
       baud rate, etc.  Without parameter, the current message is shown.

       prev

       Switch to the window with the next lower number.  This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.

       printcmd [cmd]

       If cmd is not an empty string, screen will not use the terminal capabilities po/pf if it detects an ansi print sequence ESC [ 5 i, but  pipe  the
       output into cmd.  This should normally be a command like lpr or printcmd without a command displays the current setting.  The ansi sequence ESC \
       ends printing and closes the pipe.

       Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have write access to your terminal, they will be able to fire off print commands.

       process [key]

       Stuff the contents of the specified register into screen's input queue. If no argument is given you are prompted for a register name. The text is
       parsed as if it had been typed in from the user's keyboard. This command can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.

       quit

       Kill  all  windows and terminate screen.  Note that on VT100-style terminals the keys C-4 and C-\ are identical.  This makes the default bindings
       dangerous: Be careful not to type C-a C-4 when selecting window no. 4.  Use the empty bind command (as in bind '^\') to remove a key binding.

       readbuf [encoding] [filename]

       Reads the contents of the specified file into the paste buffer.  You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the -e option.  If no  file  is
       specified, the screen-exchange filename is used.  See also bufferfile command.

       readreg [encoding] [register [filename]]

       Does  one  of  two things, dependent on number of arguments: with zero or one arguments it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the register
       specified or entered at the prompt. With two arguments it reads the contents of the named file into the  register,  just  as  readbuf  reads  the
       screen-exchange  file  into  the paste buffer.  You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the -e option.  The following example will paste
       the system's password file into the screen window (using register p, where a copy remains):

                C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd
                C-a : paste p

       redisplay

       Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full redisplay when in partial redraw mode.

       register [-eencoding]key-string

       Save the specified string to the register key.  The encoding of the string can be specified via the -e option.  See also the paste command.

       remove

       Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is only one region.

       removebuf

       Unlinks the screen-exchange file used by the commands writebuf and readbuf.

       rendition [ bell | monitor | silence | so ] attr [ color ]

       Change the way screen renders the titles of windows that have monitor or bell flags set in caption or hardstatus or windowlist.  See  the  STRING
       ESCAPES  chapter for the syntax of the modifiers.  The default for monitor is currently =b  (bold, active colors), for bell =ub  (underline, bold
       and active colors), and =u for silence.

       reset

       Reset the virtual terminal to its power-on values. Useful when strange settings (like scroll regions or graphics character  set)  are  left  over
       from an application.

       resize [-h|-v|-b|-l|-p] [[+|-] n[%] |=|max|min|_|0]

       Resize  the  current region. The space will be removed from or added to the surrounding regions depending on the order of the splits.  The avail-
       able options for resizing are `-h'(horizontal), `-v'(vertical), `-b'(both), `-l'(local to layer),  and  `-p'(perpendicular).  Horizontal  resizes
       will  add  or remove width to a region, vertical will add or remove height, and both will add or remove size from both dimensions. Local and per-
       pendicular are similar to horizontal and vertical, but they take in account of how a region was split.  If a region's last split was  horizontal,
       a  local  resize will work like a vertical resize. If a region's last split was vertical, a local resize will work like a horizontal resize. Per-
       pendicular resizes work in opposite of local resizes. If no option is specified, local is the default.

       The amount of lines to add or remove can be expressed a couple of different ways. By specifying a number n by itself will resize  the  region  by
       that  absolute  amount. You can specify a relative amount by prefixing a plus `+' or minus `-' to the amount, such as adding +n lines or removing
       -n lines. Resizing can also be expressed as an absolute or relative percentage by postfixing a percent sign `%'. Using zero `0' is a synonym  for
       `min' and using an underscore `_' is a synonym for `max'.

       Some examples are:

       resize +N
              increase current region by N

       resize -N
              decrease current region by N

       resize  N
              set current region to N

       resize 20%
              set current region to 20% of original size

       resize +20%
              increase current region by 20%

       resize -b =
              make all windows equally

       resize  max
              maximize current region

       resize  min
              minimize current region

       Without any arguments, screen will prompt for how you would like to resize the current region.

       See focusminsize if you want to restrict the minimum size a region can have.

       screen [-opts] [n] [cmd [args]|//group]

       Establish  a  new window.  The flow-control options (-f, -fn and -fa), title (a.k.a.) option (-t), login options (-l and -ln) , terminal type op-
       tion (-T <term>), the all-capability-flag (-a) and scrollback option (-h <num>) may be specified with each command.  The option (-M) turns  moni-
       toring  on for this window.  The option (-L) turns output logging on for this window.  If an optional number n in the range 0..MAXWIN-1 is given,
       the window number n is assigned to the newly created window (or, if this number is already in-use, the next available number).  If a  command  is
       specified after screen, this command (with the given arguments) is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created.  If //group is supplied,
       a container-type window is created in which other windows may be created inside it.

       Thus, if your .screenrc contains the lines

                # example for .screenrc:
                screen 1
                screen -fn -t foobar -L 2 telnet foobar

       screen creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window with a TELNET connection to the machine foobar (with no flow-control  using  the  title
       foobar  in  window #2) and will write a logfile (screenlog.2) of the telnet session.  Note, that unlike previous versions of screen no additional
       default window is created when screen commands are included in your .screenrc file. When the initialization is completed, screen switches to  the
       last window specified in your .screenrc file or, if none, opens a default window #0.

       Screen has built in some functionality of cu and telnet.  See also chapter WINDOW TYPES.

       scrollback num

       Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current windows to num lines. The default scrollback is 100 lines.  See also the defscrollback com-
       mand and use info to view the current setting. To access and use the contents in the scrollback buffer, use the copy command.

       select [WindowID]

       Switch to the window identified by WindowID.  This can be a prefix of a window title (alphanumeric window name) or a window number.  The  parame-
       ter  is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an identifier.  When a new window is established, the first available number is assigned to
       this window.  Thus, the first window can be activated by select 0.  The number of windows is limited at compile-time by the MAXWIN  configuration
       parameter  (which  defaults  to  40).  There are two special WindowIDs, - selects the internal blank window and . selects the current window. The
       latter is useful if used with screen's -X option.

       sessionname [name]

       Rename the current session. Note, that for screen -list the name shows up with the process-id prepended. If the argument  name  is  omitted,  the
       name  of  this session is displayed. Caution: The $STY environment variables will still reflect the old name in pre-existing shells. This may re-
       sult in confusion. Use of this command is generally discouraged. Use the -S command-line option if you want to name a new session.   The  default
       is constructed from the tty and host names.

       setenv [var [string]]

       Set  the  environment  variable var to value string.  If only var is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value.  If no parameters are
       specified, the user will be prompted for both variable and value. The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells.

       setsid [ on | off ]

       Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for the windows. If setsid is turned off, this is not done  anymore  and  all  windows
       will be in the same process group as the screen backend process. This also breaks job-control, so be careful.  The default is on, of course. This
       command is probably useful only in rare circumstances.

       shell command

       Set the command to be used to create a new shell.  This overrides the value of the environment variable $SHELL.  This is useful if you'd like  to
       run  a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the program specified in $SHELL.  If the command begins with a '-' character, the shell will be
       started as a login-shell. Typical shells do only minimal initialization when not started  as  a  login-shell.   E.g.  Bash  will  not  read  your
       ~/.bash_profile unless it is a login-shell.

       shelltitle title

       Set  the  title  for all shells created during startup or by the C-A C-c command.  For details about what a title is, see the discussion entitled
       TITLES (naming windows).

       silence [ on | off | sec ]

       Toggles silence monitoring of windows.  When silence is turned on and an affected window is switched into the background, you  will  receive  the
       silence  notification  message  in  the status line after a specified period of inactivity (silence). The default timeout can be changed with the
       `silencewait' command or by specifying a number of seconds instead of `on' or `off'.  Silence is initially off for all windows.

       silencewait sec

       Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait before displaying a message. Default 30 seconds.

       sleep num

       This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for num seconds.  Keyboard activity will end the sleep.  It may be used to give users a
       chance to read the messages output by echo.

       slowpaste msec

       Define  the  speed  at  which text is inserted into the current window by the paste ("C-a ]") command.  If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is
       written character by character.  screen will make a pause of msec milliseconds after each single character write  to  allow  the  application  to
       process its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying system exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of text.

       sort

       Sort the windows in alphabetical order of the window tiles.

       source file

       Read  and execute commands from file file. Source commands may be nested to a maximum recursion level of ten. If file is not an absolute path and
       screen is already processing a source command, the parent directory of the running source command file is used to search for the new command file
       before screen's current directory.

       Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at startup and reattach time, so they must be reached via the default screenrc files to
       have an effect.

       sorendition [attr[color]]

       This command is deprecated. See "rendition so" instead.

       split[-v]

       Split the current region into two new ones. All regions on the display are resized to make room for the new region. The blank window is displayed
       in the new region. The default is to create a horizontal split, putting the new regions on the top and bottom of each other. Using `-v' will cre-
       ate a vertical split, causing the new regions to appear side by side of each other.  Use the remove or the only command to delete  regions.   Use
       focus to toggle between regions.

       When  a  region  is split opposite of how it was previously split (that is, vertical then horizontal or horizontal then vertical), a new layer is
       created. The layer is used to group together the regions that are split the same. Normally, as a user, you should not see nor have to worry about
       layers, but they will affect how some commands (focus and resize) behave.

       With this current implementation of screen, scrolling data will appear much slower in a vertically split region than one that is not. This should
       be taken into consideration if you need to use system commands such as cat or tail -f.

       startup_message [ on | off ]

       Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup.  Default is `on', as you probably noticed.

       status [ top | up | down | bottom ] [ left | right ]

       The status window by default is in bottom-left corner. This command can move status messages to any corner of the screen. top is the same as  up,
       down is the same as bottom.

       stuff [string]

       Stuff the string string in the input buffer of the current window.  This is like the paste command but with much less overhead.  Without a param-
       eter, screen will prompt for a string to stuff.  You cannot paste large buffers with the stuff command. It is most useful for key  bindings.  See
       also bindkey.

       su [username [password [password2]]]

       Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts for all parameters that are omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters, they have to
       be specified un-crypted. The first password is matched against the systems passwd database, the second password is  matched  against  the  screen
       password  as set with the commands acladd or password.  Su may be useful for the screen administrator to test multiuser setups.  When the identi-
       fication fails, the user has access to the commands available for user nobody.  These are detach, license, version, help and displays.

       suspend

       Suspend screen.  The windows are in the `detached' state, while screen is suspended. This feature relies on the shell being able to do  job  con-
       trol.

       term term

       In  each  window's  environment screen opens, the $TERM variable is set to screen by default.  But when no description for screen is installed in
       the local termcap or terminfo data base, you set $TERM to - say - vt100. This won't do much harm, as screen is VT100/ANSI compatible.  The use of
       the  term  command  is  discouraged  for  non-default purpose.  That is, one may want to specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100) for the next
       screen rlogin othermachine command. Use the command screen -T vt100 rlogin othermachine rather than setting and resetting the default.

       termcap term terminal-tweaks[window-tweaks]

       terminfo term terminal-tweaks[window-tweaks]

       termcapinfo term terminal-tweaks[window-tweaks]

       Use this command to modify your terminal's termcap entry without going through all the hassles involved  in  creating  a  custom  termcap  entry.
       Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the windows.  You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc startup files,
       as they are meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted.

       If your system uses the terminfo database rather than termcap, screen will understand the `terminfo' command, which has the same effects  as  the
       `termcap'  command.  Two separate commands are provided, as there are subtle syntactic differences, e.g. when parameter interpolation (using `%')
       is required. Note that termcap names of the capabilities have to be used with the `terminfo' command.

       In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and termcap syntax, you can use the command `termcapinfo', which is just  a  short-
       hand for a pair of `termcap' and `terminfo' commands with identical arguments.

       The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be affected by this definition.  You can specify multiple terminal names by separating them
       with `|'s.  Use `*' to match all terminals and `vt*' to match all terminals that begin with vt.

       Each tweak argument contains one or more termcap defines (separated by `:'s) to be inserted at the start of the appropriate  termcap  entry,  en-
       hancing  it or overriding existing values.  The first tweak modifies your terminal's termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses to
       perform certain functions.  Specify a null string to leave this unchanged (e.g. '').  The second (optional) tweak modifies all the  window  term-
       caps, and should contain definitions that screen understands (see the VIRTUAL TERMINAL section).

       Some examples:

              termcap xterm*  LP:hs@

       Informs  screen  that all terminals that begin with `xterm' have firm auto-margins that allow the last position on the screen to be updated (LP),
       but they don't really have a status line (no 'hs' - append `@' to turn entries off).  Note that we assume `LP' for all terminal names that  start
       with vt, but only if you don't specify a termcap command for that terminal.
              termcap vt*  LP

       termcap vt102|vt220  Z0=\E[?3h:Z1=\E[?3l

       Specifies  the  firm-margined  `LP'  capability for all terminals that begin with `vt', and the second line will also add the escape-sequences to
       switch into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this is a VT102 or VT220.  (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in  your  termcap  to
       use the width-changing commands.)

              termcap vt100  ""  l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4

       This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key labels to each window's termcap entry.

              termcap h19|z19  am@:im=\E@:ei=\EO  dc=\E[P

       Takes  a  h19  or  z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables the insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities (the `@' in the
       `im' string is after the `=', so it is part of the string).  Having the `im' and `ei' definitions put into your  terminal's  termcap  will  cause
       screen to automatically advertise the character-insert capability in each window's termcap.  Each window will also get the delete-character capa-
       bility (dc) added to its termcap, which screen will translate into a line-update for the terminal (we're pretending it doesn't support  character
       deletion).

       If  you would like to fully specify each window's termcap entry, you should instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running screen.  See the
       discussion on the VIRTUAL TERMINAL in this manual, and the termcap(5) man page for more information on termcap definitions.

       time   [string]

       Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name, and the load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is  available  on  your
       system).  For window specific information, use info.

       If  a  string is specified, it changes the format of the time report like it is described in the STRING ESCAPES chapter. Screen uses a default of
       "%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?".

       title [windowtitle]

       Set the name of the current window to windowtitle. If no name is specified, screen prompts for one. This command was known as `aka'  in  previous
       releases.

       unbindall

       Unbind  all  the  bindings. This can be useful when screen is used solely for its detaching abilities, such as when letting a console application
       run as a daemon. If, for some reason, it is necessary to bind commands after this, use 'screen -X'.

       unsetenv var

       Unset an environment variable.

       utf8 [ on | off [ on | off ]]

       Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is enabled, the strings sent to the window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice versa. Omitting
       the  parameter  toggles  the  setting.  If  a  second parameter is given, the display's encoding is also changed (this should rather be done with
       screen's -U option).  See also defutf8, which changes the default setting of a new window.

       vbell [ on | off ]

       Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If vbell is switched on, but  your  terminal  does  not
       support a visual bell, a `vbell-message' is displayed in the status line when the bell character (^G) is received.  Visual bell support of a ter-
       minal is defined by the termcap variable `vb' (terminfo: 'flash').

       Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used.  See also `bell_msg'.

       vbell_msg [message]

       Sets the visual bell message. message is printed to the status line if the window receives a bell character (^G), vbell is set  to  on,  but  the
       terminal does not support a visual bell.  The default message is Wuff, Wuff!!.  Without a parameter, the current message is shown.

       vbellwait sec

       Define a delay in seconds after each display of screen's visual bell message. The default is 1 second.

       verbose [ on | off ]

       If  verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a window is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is off.  Without
       a parameter, the current setting is shown.

       version

       Print the current version and the compile date in the status line.

       wall message

       Write a message to all displays. The message will appear in the terminal's status line.

       width [-w|-d] [cols [lines]]

       Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to cols columns if an argument is specified.  This requires a capable  terminal  and
       the  termcap  entries Z0 and Z1.  See the termcap command for more information. You can also specify a new height if you want to change both val-
       ues.  The -w option tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice versa.

       windowlist [ -b ] [ -m ] [ -g ]

       windowlist string [string]

       windowlist title [title]

       Display all windows in a table for visual window selection.  If screen was in a window group, screen will back out of the group and then  display
       the  windows  in  that  group.  If the -b option is given, screen will switch to the blank window before presenting the list, so that the current
       window is also selectable.  The -m option changes the order of the windows, instead of sorting by window numbers screen uses its  internal  most-
       recently-used list.  The -g option will show the windows inside any groups in that level and downwards.

       The following keys are used to navigate in windowlist:

       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       k, C-p, or up      Move up one line.
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       j, C-n, or down    Move down one line.
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       C-g or escape      Exit windowlist.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The table format can be changed with the string and title option, the title is displayed as table heading, while the lines are made by using  the
       string setting. The default setting is Num Name%=Flags for the title and %3n %t%=%f for the lines.  See the STRING ESCAPES chapter for more codes
       (e.g. color settings).

       Windowlist needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 6 characters high in order to display.

       windows [ string ]

       Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows.  Each window is listed by number with the name of process that has  been  started  in
       the  window (or its title); the current window is marked with a `*'; the previous window is marked with a `-'; all the windows that are logged in
       are marked with a `$'; a background window that has received a bell is marked with a `!'; a background window that is being monitored and has had
       activity  occur  is  marked  with  an  `@'; a window which has output logging turned on is marked with `(L)'; windows occupied by other users are
       marked with `&'; windows in the zombie state are marked with `Z'.  If this list is too long to fit on the terminal's status line only the portion
       around  the  current  window  is displayed.  The optional string parameter follows the STRING ESCAPES format.  If string parameter is passed, the
       output size is unlimited.  The default command without any parameter is limited to a size of 1024 bytes.

       wrap [ on | off ]

       Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window.  When line-wrap is on, the second consecutive printable character output at the last column of
       a  line will wrap to the start of the following line.  As an added feature, backspace (^H) will also wrap through the left margin to the previous
       line.  Default is `on'. Without any options, the state of wrap is toggled.

       writebuf [-e encoding] [filename]

       Writes the contents of the paste buffer to the specified file, or the public accessible screen-exchange file if no filename  is  given.  This  is
       thought  of  as a primitive means of communication between screen users on the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded
       on the fly to match the encoding.  The filename can be set with the bufferfile command and defaults to /tmp/screen-exchange.

       writelock [ on | off | auto]

       In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able to write to the same window at once. Per default, writelock is in `auto' mode  and
       grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to switch to the particular window. When he leaves the window, other users may ob-
       tain the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current window is disabled by the command writelock off. If the user issues the  command
       writelock on he keeps the exclusive write permission while switching to other windows.

       xoff

       xon

       Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of the current window.

       zmodem [ off | auto | catch | pass ]

       zmodem sendcmd [string]

       zmodem recvcmd [string]

       Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two different modes when it detects a zmodem request: pass and catch.  If the mode is set to
       pass, screen will relay all data to the attacher until the end of the transmission is reached.  In catch mode screen acts as  a  zmodem  endpoint
       and  starts the corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is set to auto, screen will use catch if the window is a tty (e.g. a serial line), oth-
       erwise it will use pass.

       You can define the templates screen uses in catch mode via the second and the third form.

       Note also that this is an experimental feature.

       zombie [keys[onerror]]

       Per default screen windows are removed from the window list as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys is spec-
       ified  to  the  zombie command, `dead' windows will remain in the list.  The kill command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the first
       key in the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the second key, screen will attempt to resurrect the window. The process that was  ini-
       tially  running in the window will be launched again. Calling zombie without parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus making windows disap-
       pear when their process exits.

       As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows, this command should probably be called defzombie, but it isn't.

       Optionally you can put the word onerror after the keys. This will cause screen to monitor exit status of the process running in the window. If it
       exits normally ('0'), the window disappears. Any other exit value causes the window to become a zombie.

       zombie_timeout[seconds]

       Per  default  screen windows are removed from the window list as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. If zombie keys are defined (com-
       pare with above zombie command), it is possible to also set a timeout when screen tries to automatically reconnect a dead screen window.

THE MESSAGE LINE
       Screen displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a message line.  While this line is distributed to appear at the  bottom  of  the
       screen,  it  can  be  defined  to appear at the top of the screen during compilation.  If your terminal has a status line defined in its termcap,
       screen will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a line of the current screen will be temporarily overwritten and output will  be  mo-
       mentarily  interrupted. The message line is automatically removed after a few seconds delay, but it can also be removed early (on terminals with-
       out a status line) by beginning to type.

       The message line facility can be used by an application running in the current window by means of the ANSI Privacy message control sequence.  For
       instance, from within the shell, try something like:

              echo '<esc>^Hello world from window '$WINDOW'<esc>\\'

       where '<esc>' is an escape, '^' is a literal up-arrow, and '\\' turns into a single backslash.

WINDOW TYPES
       Screen provides three different window types. New windows are created with screen's screen command (see also the entry in chapter CUSTOMIZATION).
       The first parameter to the screen command defines which type of window is created. The different window types are all special cases of the normal
       type. They have been added in order to allow screen to be used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more windows.

       o  The  normal  window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is given) or any other system command that could be executed from a shell (e.g.
          slogin, etc...)

       o  If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. /dev/ttya) is specified as the first parameter, then the window is directly connected  to  this
          device.   This  window  type is similar to screen cu -l /dev/ttya.  Read and write access is required on the device node, an exclusive open is
          attempted on the node to mark the connection line as busy.  An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated list of flags  in
          the notation used by stty(1):

          <baud_rate>
                 Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission as well as receive speed.

          cs8 or cs7
                 Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.

          ixon or -ixon
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for sending data.

          ixoff or -ixoff
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving data.

          istrip or -istrip
                 Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.

          You  may want to specify as many of these options as applicable. Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to make up the parameter values
          of the connection.  These values are system dependent and may be in defaults or values saved from a previous connection.

          For tty windows, the info command shows some of the modem control lines in the status line. These may include `RTS', `CTS', 'DTR', `DSR', `CD'
          and  more.   This  depends on the available ioctl()'s and system header files as well as the on the physical capabilities of the serial board.
          Signals that are logical low (inactive) have their name preceded by an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is  logical  high  (active).
          Signals not supported by the hardware but available to the ioctl() interface are usually shown low.

          When  the  CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals is placed inside curly braces ({ and }).  When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR
          bit is set, the signals `CTS' or `CD' are shown in parenthesis, respectively.

          For tty windows, the command break causes the Data transmission line (TxD) to go low for a specified period of time. This is  expected  to  be
          interpreted as break signal on the other side.  No data is sent and no modem control line is changed when a break is issued.

       o  If the first parameter is //telnet, the second parameter is expected to be a host name, and an optional third parameter may specify a TCP port
          number (default decimal 23).  Screen will connect to a server listening on the remote host and use the telnet  protocol  to  communicate  with
          that server.

       For telnet windows, the command info shows details about the connection in square brackets ([ and ]) at the end of the status line.

              b      BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.

              e      ECHO. Local echo is disabled.

              c      SGA. The connection is in `character mode' (default: `line mode').

              t      TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the remote host.  Screen sends the name screen unless instructed otherwise (see also
                     the command `term').

              w      NAWS. The remote site is notified about window size changes.

              f      LFLOW. The remote host will send flow control information.  (Ignored at the moment.)

              Additional flags for debugging are x, t and n (XDISPLOC, TSPEED and NEWENV).

              For telnet windows, the command break sends the telnet code IAC BREAK (decimal 243) to the remote host.

              This window type is only available if screen was compiled with the ENABLE_TELNET option defined.

STRING ESCAPES
       Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the current time into messages or file names. The escape character is '%' with one
       exception: inside of a window's hardstatus '^%' ('^E') is used instead.

       Here is the full list of supported escapes:

       %      the escape character itself

       E      sets %? to true if the escape character has been pressed.

       e      encoding

       f      flags of the window, see windows for meanings of the various flags

       F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus

       h      hardstatus of the window

       H      hostname of the system

       n      window number

       P      sets %? to true if the current region is in copy/paste mode

       S      session name

       s      window size

       t      window title

       u      all other users on this window

       w      all window numbers and names. With '-' qualifier: up to the current window; with '+' qualifier: starting with the window after the current
              one.

       W      all window numbers and names except the current one

       x      the executed command including arguments running in this windows

       X      the executed command without arguments running in this windows

       ?      the part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to a non-empty string

       :      else part of '%?'

       =      pad the string to the display's width (like TeX's hfill). If a number is specified, pad to the percentage of the window's  width.   A  '0'
              qualifier  tells  screen  to  treat the number as absolute position.  You can specify to pad relative to the last absolute pad position by
              adding a '+' qualifier or to pad relative to the right margin by using '-'. The padding truncates the string  if  the  specified  position
              lies before the current position. Add the 'L' qualifier to change this.

       <      same as '%=' but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces

       >      mark the current text position for the next truncation. When screen needs to do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the marked po-
              sition gets moved to the specified percentage of the output area. (The area starts from the last absolute pad position and ends  with  the
              position specified by the truncation operator.) The 'L' qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated parts with '...'.

       {      attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next }

       `      Substitute with the output of a 'backtick' command. The length qualifier is misused to identify one of the commands.

       The  'c'  and 'C' escape may be qualified with a '0' to make screen use zero instead of space as fill character. The '0' qualifier also makes the
       '=' escape use absolute positions. The 'n' and '=' escapes understand a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n'), 'D' and 'M' can be prefixed  with  'L'  to
       generate long names, 'w' and 'W' also show the window flags if 'L' is given.

       An  attribute/color  modifier is used to change the attributes or the color settings. Its format is [attribute modifier] [color description]. The
       attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type indicator if it can be confused with a color description. The  following  change  types  are
       known:

       +      add the specified set to the current attributes

       -      remove the set from the current attributes

       !      invert the set in the current attributes

       =      change the current attributes to the specified set

       The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a combination of the following letters:

       d      dim
       u      underline
       b      bold
       r      reverse
       s      /standout
       B      blinking

       Colors  are  coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying the desired background and foreground color (in that order). The fol-
       lowing colors are known:

       k      black
       r      red
       g      green
       y      yellow
       b      blue
       m      magenta
       c      cyan
       w      white
       d      default color
       .      leave color unchanged

       The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors. You can also use the pseudo-color 'i' to set just  the  brightness  and  leave  the
       color unchanged.
       A  one  digit/letter  color description is treated as foreground or background color dependent on the current attributes: if reverse mode is set,
       the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.  If you don't like this, prefix the color with a .. If you want the same  behav-
       ior for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them with a ..
       As  a  special  case,  %{-}  restores the attributes and colors that were set before the last change was made (i.e., pops one level of the color-
       change stack).

       Examples:

       G      set color to bright green

       +b r   use bold red

       = yd   clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.

       %-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%<
              The available windows centered at the current window and truncated to the available width. The current window is displayed white on  blue.
              This can be used with hardstatus alwayslastline.

       %?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?
              The window number and title and the window's hardstatus, if one is set.  Also use a red background if this is the active focus. Useful for
              caption string.

FLOW-CONTROL
       Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how screen deals with the XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps the  interrupt  character).
       When  flow-control is turned off, screen ignores the XON and XOFF characters, which allows the user to send them to the current program by simply
       typing them (useful for the emacs editor, for instance).  The trade-off is that it will take longer for output from a normal program to pause  in
       response  to  an XOFF.  With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF characters are used to immediately pause the output of the current window.  You
       can still send these characters to the current program, but you must use the appropriate two-character screen commands (typically C-a q (xon) and
       C-a s (xoff)).  The xon/xoff commands are also useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that intercepts these characters.

       Each  window has an initial flow-control value set with either the -f option or the defflow .screenrc command. Per default the windows are set to
       automatic flow-switching.  It can then be toggled between the three states 'fixed on', 'fixed off' and 'automatic' interactively  with  the  flow
       command bound to "C-a f".

       The  automatic flow-switching mode deals with flow control using the TIOCPKT mode (like rlogin does). If the tty driver does not support TIOCPKT,
       screen tries to find out the right mode based on the current setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled, flow-control is  turned  off
       and visa versa.  Of course, you can still manipulate flow-control manually when needed.

       If  you're  running with flow-control enabled and find that pressing the interrupt key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until another
       6-8 lines have scrolled by, try running screen with the interrupt option (add the interrupt flag to the flow command in your  .screenrc,  or  use
       the -i command-line option).  This causes the output that screen has accumulated from the interrupted program to be flushed.  One disadvantage is
       that the virtual terminal's memory contains the non-flushed version of the output, which in rare cases can cause minor inaccuracies in  the  out-
       put.   For example, if you switch screens and return, or update the screen with C-a l you would see the version of the output you would have got-
       ten without interrupt being on.  Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or use auto-flow mode to turn it off automatically) when  running
       a  program  that  expects you to type the interrupt character as input, as it is possible to interrupt the output of the virtual terminal to your
       physical terminal when flow-control is enabled.  If this happens, a simple refresh of the screen with C-a l will restore it.  Give  each  mode  a
       try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.

TITLES (naming windows)
       You  can  customize  each  window's name in the window display (viewed with the windows command (C-a w)) by setting it with one of the title com-
       mands.  Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of the program created in the window.  However, it is sometimes useful to  distin-
       guish various programs of the same name or to change the name on-the-fly to reflect the current state of the window.

       The  default  name for all shell windows can be set with the shelltitle command in the .screenrc file, while all other windows are created with a
       screen command and thus can have their name set with the -t option.  Interactively, there is the title-string escape-sequence  (<esc>kname<esc>\)
       and  the title command (C-a A).  The former can be output from an application to control the window's name under software control, and the latter
       will prompt for a name when typed.  You can also bind pre-defined names to keys with the title command to set things quickly  without  prompting.
       Changing title by this escape sequence can be controlled by defdynamictitle and dynamictitle commands.

       Finally, screen has a shell-specific heuristic that is enabled by setting the window's name to search|name and arranging to have a null title es-
       cape-sequence output as a part of your prompt.  The search portion specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while the name portion specifies the
       default shell name for the window.  If the name ends in a `:' screen will add what it believes to be the current command running in the window to
       the end of the window's shell name (e.g. name:cmd).  Otherwise the current command name supersedes the shell name while it is running.

       Here's how it works:  you must modify your shell prompt to output a null title-escape-sequence (<esc>k<esc>\) as a part of your prompt.  The last
       part  of  your prompt must be the same as the string you specified for the search portion of the title.  Once this is set up, screen will use the
       title-escape-sequence to clear the previous command name and get ready for the next command.  Then, when a newline is received from the shell,  a
       search is made for the end of the prompt.  If found, it will grab the first word after the matched string and use it as the command name.  If the
       command name begins with either '!', '%', or '^' screen will use the first word on the following line (if found) in preference to the  just-found
       name.  This helps csh users get better command names when using job control or history recall commands.

       Here's some .screenrc examples:

                       screen -t top 2 nice top

       Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d version of the top command in window 2 named top rather than nice.

                       shelltitle '> |csh'
                       screen 1

       These  commands  would  start a shell with the given shelltitle.  The title specified is an auto-title that would expect the prompt and the typed
       command to look something like the following:

                       /usr/joe/src/dir> trn

       (it looks after the '> ' for the command name).  The window status would show the name trn while the command was running, and revert to csh  upon
       completion.

                       bind R screen -t '% |root:' su

       Having  this  command  in  your  .screenrc would bind the key sequence C-a R to the su command and give it an auto-title name of root:.  For this
       auto-title to work, the screen could look something like this:

                       % !em
                       emacs file.c

       Here the user typed the csh history command !em which ran the previously entered emacs command.  The window status would show  root:emacs  during
       the execution of the command, and revert to simply root: at its completion.

                       bind o title
                       bind E title ""
                       bind u title (unknown)

       The first binding doesn't have any arguments, so it would prompt you for a title when you type C-a o.  The second binding would clear an auto-ti-
       tle's current setting (C-a E).  The third binding would set the current window's title to (unknown) (C-a u).

       One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence to your prompt is that some shells (like the csh) count  all  the  non-control
       characters  as  part  of the prompt's length.  If these invisible characters aren't a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will result in an
       incorrect display.  One way to get around this is to use a prompt like this:

                       set prompt='^[[0000m^[k^[\% '

       The escape-sequence <esc>[0000m not only normalizes the character attributes, but all the zeros round the length of the invisible  characters  up
       to 8.  Bash users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in the PROMPT_COMMAND:

                       PROMPT_COMMAND='printf "\033k\033\134"'

       (I used \134 to output a `\' because of a bug in bash v1.04).

THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL
       Each  window  in a screen session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other terminal
       types can be emulated.
       Usually screen tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard as possible. But if your terminal lacks certain  capabilities,  the  emulation
       may not be complete. In these cases screen has to tell the applications that some of the features are missing. This is no problem on machines us-
       ing termcap, because screen can use the $TERMCAP variable to customize the standard screen termcap.

       But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your machine supports only terminfo this method fails. Because of this, screen offers a way to  deal
       with these cases.  Here is how it works:

       When screen tries to figure out a terminal name for itself, it first looks for an entry named screen.<term>, where <term> is the contents of your
       $TERM variable.  If no such entry exists, screen tries screen (or screen-w if the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)).  If even this entry  can-
       not be found, vt100 is used as a substitute.

       The  idea  is that if you have a terminal which doesn't support an important feature (e.g. delete char or clear to EOS) you can build a new term-
       cap/terminfo entry for screen (named screen.<dumbterm>) in which this capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on  your  machines
       you  are  able  to do a rlogin and still keep the correct termcap/terminfo entry.  The terminal name is put in the $TERM variable of all new win-
       dows.  Screen also sets the $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities of the virtual terminal emulated. Notice that, however, on machines us-
       ing the terminfo database this variable has no effect.  Furthermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the window number of each window.

       The  actual  set  of  capabilities supported by the virtual terminal depends on the capabilities supported by the physical terminal.  If, for in-
       stance, the physical terminal does not support underscore mode, screen does not put the `us' and `ue' capabilities  into  the  window's  $TERMCAP
       variable, accordingly.  However, a minimum number of capabilities must be supported by a terminal in order to run screen; namely scrolling, clear
       screen, and direct cursor addressing (in addition, screen does not run on hardcopy terminals or on terminals that over-strike).

       Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by screen by using the termcap .screenrc command, or by defining the variable $SCREENCAP prior to
       startup.  When the latter is defined, its value will be copied verbatim into each window's $TERMCAP variable.  This can either be the full termi-
       nal definition, or a filename where the terminal screen (and/or screen-w) is defined.

       Note that screen honors the terminfo .screenrc command if the system uses the terminfo database rather than termcap.

       When the boolean `G0' capability is present in the termcap entry for the terminal on which screen has been  called,  the  terminal  emulation  of
       screen  supports  multiple character sets.  This allows an application to make use of, for instance, the VT100 graphics character set or national
       character sets.  The following control functions from ISO 2022 are supported: lock shift G0 (SI), lock shift G1 (SO), lock shift G2,  lock  shift
       G3,  single  shift G2, and single shift G3.  When a virtual terminal is created or reset, the ASCII character set is designated as G0 through G3.
       When the `G0' capability is present, screen evaluates the capabilities `S0', `E0', and `C0' if present. `S0' is the sequence the terminal uses to
       enable  and  start  the graphics character set rather than SI.  `E0' is the corresponding replacement for SO. `C0' gives a character by character
       translation string that is used during semi-graphics mode. This string is built like the `acsc' terminfo capability.

       When the `po' and `pf' capabilities are present in the terminal's termcap entry, applications running in a screen window can send output  to  the
       printer  port  of  the  terminal.  This allows a user to have an application in one window sending output to a printer connected to the terminal,
       while all other windows are still active (the printer port is enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output).  As a  side-effect,  programs
       running  in  different windows can send output to the printer simultaneously.  Data sent to the printer is not displayed in the window.  The info
       command displays a line starting `PRIN' while the printer is active.

       Screen maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If a window gets selected, the display's hardstatus will be updated to  match  the  window's
       hardstatus  line.  If  the display has no hardstatus the line will be displayed as a standard screen message.  The hardstatus line can be changed
       with the ANSI Application Program Command (APC): ESC_<string>ESC\. As a convenience for xterm users the sequence ESC]0..2;<string>^G is also  ac-
       cepted.

       Some  capabilities  are only put into the $TERMCAP variable of the virtual terminal if they can be efficiently implemented by the physical termi-
       nal.  For instance, `dl' (delete line) is only put into the $TERMCAP variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself or scrolling re-
       gions.  Note that this may provoke confusion, when the session is reattached on a different terminal, as the value of $TERMCAP cannot be modified
       by parent processes.

       The "alternate screen" capability is not enabled by default.  Set the altscreen .screenrc command to enable it.

INPUT TRANSLATION
       In  order  to do a full VT100 emulation screen has to detect that a sequence of characters in the input stream was generated by a keypress on the
       user's keyboard and insert the VT100 style escape sequence. Screen has a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible to  map  arbitrary
       commands  on  arbitrary  sequences of characters. For standard VT100 emulation the command will always insert a string in the input buffer of the
       window (see also command stuff in the command table).  Because the sequences generated by a keypress can change after a reattach from a different
       terminal  type, it is possible to bind commands to the termcap name of the keys.  Screen will insert the correct binding after each reattach. See
       the bindkey command for further details on the syntax and examples.

       Here is the table of the default key bindings. The fourth is what command is executed if the keyboard is switched into application mode.

SPECIAL TERMINAL CAPABILITIES
       The following table describes all terminal capabilities that are recognized by screen and are not in the termcap(5) manual.  You can place  these
       capabilities  in  your termcap entries (in `/etc/termcap') or use them with the commands `termcap', `terminfo' and `termcapinfo' in your screenrc
       files. It is often not possible to place these capabilities in the terminfo database.

       LP   (bool)  Terminal has VT100 style margins (`magic margins'). Note that this capability is obsolete because screen uses the standard 'xn'  in-
                    stead.

       Z0   (str)   Change width to 132 columns.

       Z1   (str)   Change width to 80 columns.

       WS   (str)   Resize display. This capability has the desired width and height as arguments. SunView(tm) example: '\E[8;%d;%dt'.

       NF   (bool)  Terminal doesn't need flow control. Send ^S and ^Q direct to the application. Same as 'flow off'. The opposite of this capability is
                    'nx'.

       G0   (bool)  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022 font selection sequences.

       S0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset. Default is '\E(%.'.

       E0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset. Default is '\E(B'.

       C0   (str)   Use the string as a conversion table for font '0'. See the 'ac' capability for more details.

       CS   (str)   Switch cursor-keys to application mode.

       CE   (str)   Switch cursor-keys back to normal mode.

       AN   (bool)  Turn on autonuke. See the 'autonuke' command for more details.

       OL   (num)   Set the output buffer limit. See the 'obuflimit' command for more details.

       KJ   (str)   Set the encoding of the terminal. See the 'encoding' command for valid encodings.

       AF   (str)   Change character foreground color in an ANSI conform way. This capability will almost always be set to  '\E[3%dm'  ('\E[3%p1%dm'  on
                    terminfo machines).

       AB   (str)   Same as 'AF', but change background color.

       AX   (bool)  Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color (\E[39m / \E[49m).

       XC   (str)   Describe a translation of characters to strings depending on the current font. More details follow in the next section.

       XT   (bool)  Terminal understands special xterm sequences (OSC, mouse tracking).

       C8   (bool)  Terminal needs bold to display high-intensity colors (e.g. Eterm).

       TF   (bool)  Add missing capabilities to the termcap/info entry. (Set by default).

CHARACTER TRANSLATION
       Screen  has  a powerful mechanism to translate characters to arbitrary strings depending on the current font and terminal type.  Use this feature
       if you want to work with a common standard character set (say ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the  more  unusual  characters  over
       several national language font pages.

       Syntax:
           XC=<charset-mapping>{,,<charset-mapping>}
           <charset-mapping> := <designator><template>{,<mapping>}
           <mapping> := <char-to-be-mapped><template-arg>

       The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.

       A <charset-mapping> tells screen how to map characters in font <designator> ('B': Ascii, 'A': UK, 'K': German, etc.)  to strings. Every <mapping>
       describes to what string a single character will be translated. A template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes have a lot in  common
       (for example strings to switch to and from another charset). Each occurrence of '%' in <template> gets substituted with the <template-arg> speci-
       fied together with the character. If your strings are not similar at all, then use '%' as a template and place the full string in <template-arg>.
       A quoting mechanism was added to make it possible to use a real '%'. The '\' character quotes the special characters '\', '%', and ','.

       Here is an example:

           termcap hp700 'XC=B\E(K%\E(B,\304[,\326\\\\,\334]'

       This  tells  screen  how  to translate ISOlatin1 (charset 'B') upper case umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a German charset. '\304'
       gets translated to '\E(K[\E(B' and so on.  Note that this line gets parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built,  therefore  a
       lot of quoting is needed to create a single '\'.

       Another  extension  was  added  to  allow more emulation: If a mapping translates the unquoted '%' char, it will be sent to the terminal whenever
       screen switches to the corresponding <designator>. In this special case the template is assumed to be just '%' because  the  charset  switch  se-
       quence and the character mappings normally haven't much in common.

       This example shows one use of the extension:

           termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\E(B,[\304,\\\\\326,]\334'

       Here,  a part of the German ('K') charset is emulated on an xterm.  If screen has to change to the 'K' charset, '\E(B' will be sent to the termi-
       nal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The template is just '%', so the mapping is straightforward: '[' to '\304', '\' to '\326',  and  ']'
       to '\334'.

AVAILABILITY
       The latest official release of screen available via anonymous ftp from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/screen/ or any other GNU distribution site. The home  page
       of  screen  is  https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/screen/ and the git repo is https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git.  If you want to help,
       send a note to screen-devel@gnu.org.

BUGS
       o  `dm' (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled correctly (they are ignored). `xn' is treated as a magic-margin indicator.

       o  Screen has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters.  But this is the only area where vttest is allowed to fail.

       o  It is not possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when reattaching under a different terminal type.

       o  The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.

       o  Screen does not make use of hardware tabs.

       o  Screen must be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems in order to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty  device  file
          for each window.  Special permission may also be required to write the file /run/utmp.

       o  Entries in /run/utmp are not removed when screen is killed with SIGKILL.  This will cause some programs (like "w" or "rwho") to advertise that
          a user is logged on who really isn't.

       o  Screen may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.

       o  When the modem line was hung up, screen may not automatically detach (or quit) unless the device driver is configured to send a HANGUP signal.
          To detach a screen session use the -D or -d command line option.

       o  If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still detach a session without asking.

       o  Both  breaktype  and  defbreaktype  change the break generating method used by all terminal devices. The first should change a window specific
          setting, where the latter should change only the default for new windows.

       o  When attaching to a multiuser session, the user's .screenrc file is not sourced. Each user's personal settings have  to  be  included  in  the
          .screenrc file from which the session is booted, or have to be changed manually.

       o  A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the features.

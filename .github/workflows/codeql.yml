      # Autobuild step:
      # - For "go", CodeQL does not strictly need a traditional build; it can
      #   analyze the source directly.
      # - For "cpp", CodeQL tries to automatically build the project to
      #   understand the compiled artifacts (C/C++ code).
      #
      # If autobuild fails for your C parts, you may need to:
      #   - remove this step, and
      #   - add a manual build step (e.g. make, cmake, etc.).

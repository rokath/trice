<component name="NamedScopeManager">
  <!--
    Scope name shown in CLion/IntelliJ UI:
      "TriceReview"

    Purpose:
      Run "Inspect Code..." over the whole repository (project root),
      while excluding selected folders that should not be reviewed (e.g. legacy docs).

    Where this file must live:
      <repo-root>/.idea/scopes/any_name.xml

    Usage in CLion:
      Code → Inspect Code… → Scope: TriceReview

    Notes:
    - This scope only affects tools that support "Scope" selection (Inspect Code, Find in Files, etc.).
    - It does NOT affect compilation/build.
    - Paths are relative to the opened project root (here: trice/).
    - The scope is identified by the attribute name="TriceReview".
      The filename itself is irrelevant.
      It does NOT change the build, does NOT remove files from the project tree,
      and does NOT stop indexing unless you additionally mark directories as "Excluded".
    - This scope only affects features that accept a "Scope" selection, e.g.:
        Code → Inspect Code... → Scope: TriceFullReview
    - Path patterns are relative to the opened project root (here: <repo-root>/trice).
      So "docs/_legacy//*" matches:
        <repo-root>/trice/docs/_legacy/<anything>
    - The pattern language supports boolean operators:
        &&  (AND)
        ||  (OR)
        !   (NOT)
    - Keep the scope name stable. Other CLion settings may refer to it by name.
      The filename is arbitrary; CLion uses the scope's "name=" attribute.
    - Customization:
      Add more exclusions by appending more "&& !file:...//*" clauses, e.g.:
        && !file:src/vendor//*         (exclude vendor code)
        && !file:_test/testdata//*     (exclude generated test data)
  -->
  <scope
    name="TriceReview"
    pattern="
      file:*//* 
      && !file:.git//* 
      && !file:docs/_Legacy//* 
      && !file:third_party//* 
      && !file:src/SEGGER_RTT.*
    " />
